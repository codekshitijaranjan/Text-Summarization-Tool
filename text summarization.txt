People across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.

In our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.

It is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.

The bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.

There are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.

'भारत विकसित संकल्प यात्रा को सफल बनाने के लिए देशभर में सरकार, राजनीतिक और सामाजिक गतिविधियों में शामिल लोग अपना समय समर्पित कर रहे हैं। इसलिए, संसद के सदस्य के रूप में इस कार्यक्रम में भाग लेने के लिए मेरी जिम्मेदारी भी थी। तो, आज, मैं यहां सदस्य और आपका सेवक के रूप में पहुंचा हूं, जैसे ही आप लोगों के साथ इस कार्यक्रम में भाग लेने के लिए तैयार हूं।\n\nहमारे देश में, सरकारें आईं और चली गईं, अनेक योजनाएं तैयार की गईं, चर्चाएं हुईं और बड़े वादे किए गए हैं। हालांकि, मेरे अनुभव और अवलोकन ने मुझे यह समझाया है कि सबसे महत्वपूर्ण पहलू यह है कि सरकार की योजनाएं निर्धारित लाभार्थियों तक कोई परेशानी के बिना पहुंचे। अगर \'प्रधानमंत्री आवास योजना\' है तो उन लोगों को भी अपने घर प्राप्त होने चाहिए जो झुग्गी और स्लम में रह रहे हैं। और उसके लिए वह सरकारी कार्यालयों के चक्कर नहीं काटने की ज़रूरत होनी चाहिए। सरकार को उसके पास पहुंचनी चाहिए। जबसे आपने मुझे इस ज़िम्मेदारी को सौंपा है, लगभग चार करोड़ परिवारों को उनके पक्के घर मिल गए हैं। हालांकि, मैंने ऐसे मामले देखे हैं जहां किसी को सरकारी लाभ मिला ही नहीं। इसलिए, मैंने देश भर में फिर से यात्रा करने का फैसला किया है, लोगों की सरकारी योजनाओं के साथ अनुभव सुनने के लिए, यह जानने के लिए कि क्या उन्होंने इच्छित लाभ प्राप्त किया है और यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए कि कार्यक्रम सभी के पास यहां तक पहुंच रहा है जैसा योजना में निर्धारित है, किसी को घूस नहीं देने की आवश्यकता है। हम उन्हें फिर से ज़रूर देखेंगे तो हमें असली तस्वीर मिलेगी। इसलिए, यह \'विकसित भारत संकल्प यात्रा\' एक तरह से मेरी अपनी परीक्षा है। मैं आपसे और देशभर के लोगों से जानना चाहता हूं कि मेरे ध्यान में आपके साथ जो विचार आया था और मैंने जो काम किया है, क्या यह वास्तविकता के साथ मेल खाता है और क्या यह उन लोगों तक पहुंचा है जिनके लिए यह मांगा गया था।\n\nयह महत्वपूर्ण है कि काम जो होना चाहिए, क्या वास्तव में हो गया है यह जांचा जाए। हाल ही में मैंने कुछ लोगों से मिले जिन्होंने गंभीर बीमारियों के उपचार के लिए आयुष्मान कार्ड का उपयोग किया। एक व्यक्ति का गंभीर दुर्घटना में सामना हुआ था और कार्ड का उपयोग करने के बाद, उसने आवश्यक ऑपरेशन कराने की सामर्थ्य प्राप्त की और अब वह पूरी तरह से ठीक हो रहा है। जब मैंने उससे पूछा, तो उसने कहा: "मैं इस उपचार का कैसे सामर्थ्य रख सकता था? अब जब आयुष्मान कार्ड है, तो मैंने हिम्मत जुटाई और एक ऑपरेशन करवाया। अब मैं पूरी तरह से ठीक हूं।" ऐसी कहानियाँ मेरे लिए आशीर्वाद हैं।\n\nअच्छी योजना तैयार करने वाले नौकरशाहों को भी संतुष्टि होती है कि 50 या 100 लोग, जिन्हें धन प्राप्त होना चाहिए था, उसे प्राप्त कर लेते हैं। हजारों गांवों के लिए धन जारी किए गए हैं। लेकिन उनकी कार्य संतुष्टि उस समय होती है जब उन्हें यह सुनने को मिलता है कि उनका काम किसी के जीवन पर सीधा प्रभाव डाल रहा है। जब वे अपने प्रयासों के प्रत्यक्ष परिणामों को देखते हैं, तो उनका उत्साह बढ़ जाता है। उन्हें संतुष्टि मिलती है। इसलिए, \'विकसित भारत संकल्प यात्रा\' ने सरकारी अधिकारियों पर सकारात्मक प्रभाव डाला है। इसने उन्हें उनके काम के प्रति और विशेष रूप से जब वे देखते हैं कि वास्तविक लाभ लोगों तक पहुंच रहा है, तो उनकी उत्साहिता बढ़ जाती है। अधिकारियों को अब अपने काम से संतुष्टि मिलती है, कहते हैं, "मैंने एक अच्छी योजना बनाई, मैंने एक फ़ाइल तैयार की, और निर्धारित लाभार्थियों को लाभ प्राप्त हुआ।" जब एक सरकारी अधिकारी ऐसी कहानियों को सुनता है, तो उसे बहुत संतुष्टि मिलती है।\n\n\'विकसित भारत संकल्प यात्रा\' की शक्ति और प्रभाव को समझने वाले बहुत कम हैं। जब मैं ब्यूरोक्रेटिक सर्कल्स से जुड़े लोगों से इसके बारे में बात करते सुनता हूं, और उनकी संतुष्टि की अभिव्यक्ति सुनता हूं, तो वह मेरे साथ संब'

'A P J Abdul Kalam Departing speech \n \n \nFriends, I am delighted to address you all, in the country and those livi ng abroad, after \nworking with you and completing five beautiful and eventful years in Rashtrapati \nBhavan. Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \nfollowing important messages: \n \n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \n \n2. Empower villages, \n \n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \n \n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \n \n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \n \n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \n \n7. Courage in combating calamities, \n \n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \n \n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \n \n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \n \nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \n \nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \nafter. \n \nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \n \nEmpower Villages \nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \nsocieties. \n \nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \nwhole region. \n \nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \nbridging the rural – urban divide. \n \nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \nfor value addition. \n \nDefeat the problems and succeed \nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. \nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \ncould blossom in this \nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \ntheatre. \n \nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely  damaged. \nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. T he villagers apprised me of \ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \nallowing problems to become their master. Despite the severe l oss due to the earthquake, the children and the members of the village participated in the reli ef operation with the \nArmed Forces \nbravely and were smiling when I went to meet them. They interact ed with me and said \nthat the school was functional in the temporary tents. Here, I also witnessed the \nparticipation of acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir along with State Government \nauthorities in on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to be provide d to the victims whose \nhouses had been damaged in the earth quake. I have experienced many s uch acts of \ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \n \nCourage in combating calamities \nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha  village \nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \nWaves” which reads as follows: \nSea Waves \n \nWe are the children of Sea waves, \nSea waves are my friends. \nWhen they become angry, \nSea waves give the challenges. \nGod has given the courage, \nTo challenge the sea waves. \nAnd we will succeed, \nWe will succeed \nWith Almighty’s grace. \nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \nduring the Tsunami. \n \nConnectivity for societal transformation \nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \n \nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Afri ca), 17 Super \nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot proj ect on tele-education and \ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned. Indira Gandh i National Open \nUniversity has taken up the MBA Course for 34 Ethiopian students of Addis  Ababa and \nHarmaya Universities. As regards, tele-medicine, the special ists from CARE Hospital, Hyderabad are providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in B lack Lion \nHospital, Addis Ababa in Cardiology and Radiology since November 2006. Using the \nPan African network the Heads of the State in all the 53 countries  will be connected for \ninstant communication. I am extremely happy that Indian experience  in bringing the \nbenefits of technology to the people has enabled us to work with Afric a to bring societal \ntransformation in the African continent. \n \nDefending the nation: Our pride \nI visited KUMAR in Siachen Glacier located at 17,000 feet altitude  held by the Indian \nArmy, had a memorable underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak and flew  in a Sukhoi-\n30 fighter experiencing 2.5 g. In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \n \nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \nare on the right path \nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \neducation and leadership. \n \nConclusion \nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours. I have cited thes e examples just to \ngive a glimpse of the richness of our tradition and effort being take n by different agencies to preserve it. There are also many new adventures by instituti ons and individuals. I have \nexperienced many of them and learnt a lot about my country and our peopl e. Even while \npursuing our economic growth, we need to do a lot to preserve the rich and diverse \ntreasures of our culture and civilization. It is our duty for our fut ure generations. This has \nto be done in a much larger scale through countrywide participatio n of multiple \ninstitutions. Our country is blessed with natural resources, has shown c onsiderable \nprogress in the last sixty years, and above all we have hard wor king people particularly \nthe power of the 540 million youth of the country. Every sector of our count ry has given \nme the \nconfidence that India can become a developed nation well before 2020. Whomsoeve r, I \nmet they constantly ask what they can give to the nation. We should c onstantly strive to \nempower such members of the society. With this spirit, I am extr emely happy that we are \non the right path. Here I am reminded of a famous poem: \n"When you wish upon a star, \nMakes no difference who you are, \nAnything your heart desires, \nWill come to you” \nThis poem is true to all of us, and particularly for our youth and i f they aim great, I am \nsure they will reach close to the target or the target. \n \nMy dear citizens, let us resolve to continue to work for realizing the missions of \ndeveloped India 2020 with the following distinctive profile. \n \n1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line. \n \n2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate acce ss to energy and \nquality water. \n \n3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service sector work together in sym phony. \n \n4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious \ncandidates because of societal or economic discrimination. \n \n5. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented s cholars, scientists, and \ninvestors. \n \n6. A Nation where the best of health care is available to all. \n \n7. A Nation where the governance is responsive, transparent and corruption free. \n \n8. A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiterac y removed and crimes \nagainst women and children are absent and none in the society feels alienated. \n \n9.

[Document(page_content='A P J Abdul Kalam Departing speech \n \n \nFriends, I am delighted to address you all, in the country and those livi ng abroad, after \nworking with you and completing five beautiful and eventful years in Rashtrapati \nBhavan. Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \nfollowing important messages: \n \n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \n \n2. Empower villages, \n \n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \n \n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \n \n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \n \n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \n \n7. Courage in combating calamities, \n \n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \n \n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \n \n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \n \nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \n \nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \nafter. \n \nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \n \nEmpower Villages \nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \nsocieties. \n \nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \nwhole region. \n \nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \nbridging the rural – urban divide. \n \nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \nfor value addition. \n \nDefeat the problems and succeed \nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. \nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \ncould blossom in this \nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \ntheatre. \n \nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely  damaged. \nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. T he villagers apprised me of \ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \nallowing problems to become their master. Despite the severe l oss due to the earthquake, the children and the members of the village participated in the reli ef operation with the \nArmed Forces \nbravely and were smiling when I went to meet them. They interact ed with me and said \nthat the school was functional in the temporary tents. Here, I also witnessed the \nparticipation of acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir along with State Government \nauthorities in on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to be provide d to the victims whose \nhouses had been damaged in the earth quake. I have experienced many s uch acts of \ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \n \nCourage in combating calamities \nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha  village \nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \nWaves” which reads as follows: \nSea Waves \n \nWe are the children of Sea waves, \nSea waves are my friends. \nWhen they become angry, \nSea waves give the challenges. \nGod has given the courage, \nTo challenge the sea waves. \nAnd we will succeed, \nWe will succeed \nWith Almighty’s grace. \nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited \nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \nduring the Tsunami. \n \nConnectivity for societal transformation \nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South \nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \n \nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Afri ca), 17 Super \nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot proj ect on tele-education and \ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned. Indira Gandh i National Open \nUniversity has taken up the MBA Course for 34 Ethiopian students of Addis  Ababa and \nHarmaya Universities. As regards, tele-medicine, the special ists from CARE Hospital, Hyderabad are providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in B lack Lion \nHospital, Addis Ababa in Cardiology and Radiology since November 2006. Using the \nPan African network the Heads of the State in all the 53 countries  will be connected for \ninstant communication. I am extremely happy that Indian experience  in bringing the \nbenefits of technology to the people has enabled us to work with Afric a to bring societal \ntransformation in the African continent. \n \nDefending the nation: Our pride \nI visited KUMAR in Siachen Glacier located at 17,000 feet altitude  held by the Indian \nArmy, had a memorable underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak and flew  in a Sukhoi-\n30 fighter experiencing 2.5 g. In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \n \nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \nare on the right path \nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \neducation and leadership. \n \nConclusion \nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours. I have cited thes e examples just to \ngive a glimpse of the richness of our tradition and effort being take n by different agencies to preserve it. There are also many new adventures by instituti ons and individuals. I have \nexperienced many of them and learnt a lot about my country and our peopl e. Even while \npursuing our economic growth, we need to do a lot to preserve the rich and diverse \ntreasures of our culture and civilization. It is our duty for our fut ure generations. This has \nto be done in a much larger scale through countrywide participatio n of multiple \ninstitutions. Our country is blessed with natural resources, has shown c onsiderable \nprogress in the last sixty years, and above all we have hard wor king people particularly \nthe power of the 540 million youth of the country. Every sector of our count ry has given \nme the \nconfidence that India can become a developed nation well before 2020. Whomsoeve r, I \nmet they constantly ask what they can give to the nation. We should c onstantly strive to \nempower such members of the society. With this spirit, I am extr emely happy that we are \non the right path. Here I am reminded of a famous poem: \n"When you wish upon a star, \nMakes no difference who you are, \nAnything your heart desires, \nWill come to you” \nThis poem is true to all of us, and particularly for our youth and i f they aim great, I am \nsure they will reach close to the target or the target. \n \nMy dear citizens, let us resolve to continue to work for realizing the missions of \ndeveloped India 2020 with the following distinctive profile. \n \n1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line. \n \n2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate acce ss to energy and \nquality water. \n \n3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service sector work together in sym phony. \n \n4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious \ncandidates because of societal or economic discrimination. \n \n5. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented s cholars, scientists, and \ninvestors. \n \n6. A Nation where the best of health care is available to all. \n \n7. A Nation where the governance is responsive, transparent and corruption free. \n \n8. A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiterac y removed and crimes \nagainst women and children are absent and none in the society feels alienated. \n \n9. A Nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful and happy a nd continues with a \nsustainable growth path. \n 10. A Nation that is one of the best places to live in and is proud of its leadership. \n \nFinally let me thank each one of you for showering your love and aff ection on me \nthroughout the last five years by your cooperation and support. \n \nDear Citizens, I conclude my address by sharing with you my mission in life which is to \nbring connectivity between billion hearts and minds of the people of Indi a in our \nmulticultural society and to embed the self confidence that "we c an do it". I will be \nalways with you, dear citizens, in the great mission of making Indi a a developed nation \nbefore 2020. \n \nMay God bless you. \n \nJai hind. \nDr. A. P. J.

2022-23 comes when global uncertainties are rife. Barely had the pandemic receded, \nand\tthe\twar\tin\tUkraine\tbroke\tout\tin\tFebruary\t2022.\tPrices\tof\tfood,\tfuel\tand\tfertiliser\trose\tsharply.\tAs\tinflation\trates\t\naccelerated, central banks of advanced countries scrambled to respond with monetary policy tightening. Many \ndeveloping countries, particularly in the South Asian region, faced severe economic stress as the combination of weaker currencies, higher import prices, the rising cost of living and a stronger dollar, making debt servicing more expensive,\tproved\ttoo\tmuch\tto\thandle.\t\n In the second half of 2022, there was a respite for governments and households. Commodity prices peaked \nand then declined. In the near term, the acute pressure was relieved, although prices of some commodities (e.g., \ncrude oil) remain well above their pre-pandemic levels. For countries dependent on imports, priced and payable in dollars,\ta\tglobal\tslowdown\t led\tby\tthe\tUnited\tStates\t(US)\toffers\ta\ttriple\trelief.\tCommodity\t prices\tdecline,\tand\tUS\t\ninterest rates peak, as does the US dollar.

In anticipation, bond yields have come down, and there are\tfaint\thopes\tof\tthe\tUS\tavoiding\ta\trecession\taltogether,\tbarring\tany\tunexpected\tfinancial\tsystem\tstress. \t\n Lower chances of a downturn in advanced economies and resumption of economic activity bring with them hopes \nfor\tsome\tdeveloping\t economies\t that\tare\texport-dependent\t and\tconcerns\tfor\tthose\twho\tare\theavily\timport-dependent \t\nfor essential commodities. In anticipation of higher-than-earlier forecasted demand, crude oil prices have begun to climb, as have the prices of industrial metals. Wage negotiations are leading to upward revisions on either side of the Atlantic.\tMeaningful\t interest\trate\treductions\t in\tthe\tUS\tand\tthe\tEurozone\tmay\tnot\tmaterialise\t as\tquickly\tas\tone\twould\t\nhave hoped.

These efforts have improved investor sentiments and strengthened the growth potential.\n2.20 In particular, the taxation ecosystem in the country has undergone substantial reforms in \nthe post-2014 period. Tax policy reforms such as adopting a unified GST, reducing corporate \ntax rates, exemption of sovereign wealth funds and pension funds from taxes, and removing the Dividend Distribution tax have reduced the tax burden on individuals and businesses; and have removed the distortionary incentives from the economy. GST, for instance, has helped businesses by reducing compliances, ensuring a free flow of goods across states, doing away with the need for businesses to have a separate warehouse for every state, and hence improving the ease of doing business. The earlier indirect tax regime was origin based, and it distorted the location choices of the businesses. \n2.21 Despite tax rationalisation, a positive trend of higher tax buoyancy is visible in the \neconomy. The notable economist Indira Rajaraman termed GST ‘a revenue success’ in 2019\n20; \nthereafter, the positive GST revenue collection trends have strengthened further despite the \npandemic. The average monthly gross GST collection has increased from ₹0.90 lakh crore in FY18 to ₹1.49 lakh crore in FY23 (Figure II.9). Evidence suggests that the buoyancy of the indirect tax system replaced by GST has improved in the post-GST regime (Box III.1, Chapter 3). Since other tax reforms, such as the corporate tax cut, were followed by the pandemic-led uncertainty and disruptions, their impact on collections is gradually becoming visible in higher tax collections. The Corporate tax collections for April to November 2022 have increased by 21.1 per cent on a YoY basis compared to a longer-term average YoY growth of 10.3 per cent during the corresponding period from FY13 to FY19. \nFigure II.9: rising average monthly gross GsT collection\n0.900.981.02\n0.951.241.49\n0.60.70.80.91.01.11.21.31.41.51.6\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23₹ lakh crore\nSource: Department of Revenue\n20\u2003 Monograph titled ‘The evolving GST’ delivered by Indira Rajaraman as the Chelliah Memorial Lecture at the Madras School of Economics \nin 2019. (https://www.mse.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Monograph-43.pdf )34\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n2.22 One prominent reason behind the higher revenue buoyancy is the introduction of \ntechnology-backed tax governance reforms for simplifying tax processes, enhancing compliance, \nand improving fraud detection systems. The faceless assessment and appeal systems no longer require a physical interface between taxpayers and the Income Tax department. Moreover, multiple consistency checks possible with integrated digital systems reduce tax evasion. As an illustration, the GST return filing mechanism results in better income reporting, leading to higher direct tax collections. In this regard, the decision to share data and information between CBDT and CBIC on an automatic and regular basis is a promising reform, and it would result in efficiency gains in the tax system.even moderate growth, if sustained, \nwill support fiscal consolidation in the medium run and result in sustainable public finances. Two, India\'s public debt and deficit ratios went up sharply in recent years, not just on account of higher \nspending and lower tax revenues due to the pandemic but also due to the denominator undershooting \ntrends resulting from financial system stress, followed by the pandemic. With both out of the way, nominal growth should return to its trend path, and hence, fiscal parameters would begin to show \nimprovement. There is a need for continued vigilance and adherence to the path of fiscal prudence, \nbut an undue alarm is unwarranted.\nconclusion\n3.41. The Government of India has adopted a holistic policy towards fiscal stability in the last \nfew years. Using the crisis as an opportunity to bring about reforms, the government undertook \na series of policy measures in the previous few years. These policies range from bringing in budget transparency and using prudent assumptions in the Budget to transforming the tax ecosystem by implementing technology, rationalising GST, reducing tax rates, simplifying tax compliances, and ending the uncertainty around retrospective taxation. All these measures have led to a greater formalisation of the economy, enhanced compliances and better reporting of the income by the public and imparted credibility to the government\'s commitment to fiscal management.68\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n3.42. The spike in India\'s debt and deficit ratios has not only been due to higher spending \nnecessitated by the pandemic-induced cessation of economic activity but also due to the \ncontraction or slower growth in the denominator (nominal GDP). In FY20, India\'s GDP growth slowed down due to the ongoing stress in the financial system. While the banking sector was undergoing repair and was recapitalising, the non-banking financial sector crisis renewed the uncertainties for the banking system. This kept credit growth muted, leading to slower GDP growth.\n11 The pandemic aggravated the situation in FY21, which caused the nominal GDP to \ncontract, a rare occurrence in India. A detailed discussion may be seen in Chapter 2.\n3.43. As India\'s economic recovery advances, amidst the continuing global uncertainties and \nrisks, the fiscal glide path illuminates the path for fiscal policy. That will ensure more significant fiscal space for policy action in uncertain times. Further, in reality, fiscal discipline translates into a fiscal stimulus for all sections of the economy through lower interest rates. As governments make their fiscal situations sustainable and stick to that path, the risk premium embedded in their interest rates comes down, thus lowering the cost of capital for all sections of society - on their educational loans, housing loans, car loans and business loans – and putting more money in their hands. For EMDE, the stimulus effect of fiscal deficit, via diminishing risk-premium, is likely greater than it is for advanced economies. That is the reality, as financial markets do not treat advanced and emerging economies similarly on fiscal deficits. Therefore, it stands to reason that they reap greater rewards for fiscal prudence. As stated earlier, this is particularly relevant in an era of rising interest rates.\n3.44. The Centre should continue incentivising the States for reforms and higher capital spending \nto ensure a stronger General government. The capex-led growth strategy will ensure sustainable debt levels in the medium term.\n11IMF Working paper (WP/22/137)- Financial Sector and Economic Growth in India by Margaux MacDonald ; TengTeng Xu (July 2022) – \n(https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/08/Financial-Sector-and-Economic-Growth-in-India-520580 )69\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\nannexe\nAnnexe 1:  Data on longer-term trends in Union government finances\nTable 1: Union Government\'s Fiscal Parameters\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA FY23 BE\nIn ₹ lakh crore\nRevenue Receipts 14.35 15.53 16.84 16.34 21.68 22.04\nGross Tax Revenue 19.19 20.80 20.10 20.27 27.08 27.58\nNet tax revenue 12.42 13.17 13.57 14.26 18.20 19.35\nNon-tax revenue 1.93 2.36 3.27 2.08 3.48 2.70\nNon-debt capital receipts 1.16 1.13 0.69 0.58 0.39 0.79\nNon-debt receipts 15.51 16.66 17.53 16.92 22.08 22.84\nTotal Expenditure 21.42 23.15 26.86 35.10 37.94 39.45\nRevenue Expenditure 18.79 20.07 23.51 30.84 32.01 31.95\nCapital Expenditure 2.63 3.08 3.36 4.26 5.93 7.50\nFiscal Deficit 5.91 6.49 9.34 18.18 15.87 16.61\nRevenue Deficit 4.44 4.54 6.67 14.50 10.33 9.90\nPrimary Deficit 0.62 0.67 3.22 11.38 7.81 7.21\nMemo Item       \nGDP at Market Price 170.90 188.87 200.75 198.01 236.65 258.00\nSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA\nTable2: Union Government\'s Fiscal Parameters (Per cent of GDP)\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA FY23 BE\nRevenue Receipts 8.4 8.2 8.4 8.3 9.2 8.5\nGross Tax Revenue 11.2 11.0 10.0 10.2 11.4 10.7\nNet tax revenue 7.3 7.0 6.8 7.2 7.7 7.5\nNon-tax revenue 1.1 1.2 1.6 1.0 1.5 1.0\nNon-debt capital receipts 0.7 0.6 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.3\nNon-debt receipts 9.1 8.8 8.7 8.5 9.3 8.9\nTotal Expenditure 12.5 12.3 13.4 17.7 16.0 15.3\nRevenue Expenditure 11.0 10.6 11.7 15.6 13.5 12.4\nCapital Expenditure 1.5 1.6 1.7 2.2 2.5 2.9\nFiscal Deficit 3.5 3.4 4.7 9.2 6.7 6.4\nRevenue Deficit 2.6 2.4 3.3 7.3 4.4 3.8\nPrimary Deficit 0.4 0.4 1.6 5.7 3.3 2.8\nSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA70\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nTable 3: Growth rate of Union Government\'s Fiscal Indicators ( in per cent)\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 PA FY23 BE(1)FY23 BE(2)\nRevenue Receipts 4.4 8.2 8.4 -3.0 32.7 6.0 1.7\nGross Tax Revenue 11.8 8.4 -3.4 0.8 33.6 9.6 1.8\nNet tax revenue 12.8 6.0 3.0 5.1 27.6 9.6 6.3\nNon-tax revenue -29.4 22.3 38.8 -36.5 67.6 -14.1 -22.5\nNon-debt capital receipts 77.0 -2.5 -39.2 -16.0 -32.0 -20.7 102.2\nNon-debt receipts 7.7 7.4 5.2 -3.5 30.5 4.8 3.4\nTotal Expenditure 8.4 8.1 16.0 30.7 8.1 4.6 4.0\nRevenue Expenditure 11.1 6.8 17.1 31.2 3.8 0.9 -0.2\nCapital Expenditure -7.5 16.9 9.1 27.0 39.1 24.5 26.6\nFiscal Deficit 10.4 9.9 43.8 94.8 -12.7 4.4 4.7\nRevenue Deficit 40.2 2.5 46.7 117.5 -28.7 -9.0 -4.1\nPrimary Deficit 13.1 7.5 381.6 254.0 -31.4 -7.3 -7.8\nSource: Union Budget documents, O/o CGA\nNote: (1) Growth in FY23 BE over FY22 RE  (2) Growth in FY23 BE over FY22 PA\nAnnexe 2:  Indirect tax measures by CBIC during 2021-22\nThe reforms initiated by the government in recent years have ensured the development of \na trust-based tax system. Progress has been made to move to an efficient and effective tax administration, which honours honest taxpayers and provides better taxpayer facilitation while advancing the government\'s policy of facilitating Ease of Doing Business.\nEase of Compliance for Taxpayers\n● A new scheme of updated return has been introduced in the Income-tax Act of 1961, which facilitates the taxpayer to voluntarily update his return anytime within two years from the end of the relevant assessment year by paying an additional tax. This scheme encourages voluntary compliance and reduces litigation.\n● The scope of information in the pre-filled Income tax Returns (ITR) has been further expanded by including information such as house property income, capital gains from securities, bank interest, and dividends to make tax compliance more convenient.\n● A new provision to effect business reorganisation has been made under the Income-tax Act, 1961, requiring the successor entity to file a modified return within six months of the order of the reorganisation being passed by the Competent Authority. \n● The procedures for assessment, appeal and levy of penalty under the Income-tax Act have been made faceless by eliminating the human interface between the Assessing Officer and the assessee, optimising the use of resources through functional specialisation and streamlining the procedures to enable efficient implementation.71\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\nReduction in litigation\n● A Dispute Resolution Committee is constituted to reduce litigation and give an impetus to \ndispute resolution for small taxpayers. A taxpayer having taxable income up to ₹50 lakh and disputed income up to ₹10 lakh shall be eligible to approach the Committee. The procedure of the Committee will be conducted electronically to ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability.\n● Taking forward the policy of litigation management and to avoid repetitive appeals, a new provision has been made under the Income-tax Act, 1961, wherein if a question of law in the case of an assessee is identical to a question of law pending in appeal before the jurisdictional High Court or the Supreme Court in his case or any other case, the filing of further appeal to the Appellate Tribunal or the jurisdictional High Court in the case of the assessee shall be deferred till such question of law is decided by the relevant Court subject to certain conditions.\nMeasures undertaken to curb tax evasion & facilitate the widening of the tax base\n● A formal mechanism of sharing information through the Annual Information Statement (AIS) and e-Verification scheme has recently been enabled. These measures further the aim of widening and deepening the tax base by ensuring authorities possess all relevant financial information of an assessee, thus allowing access to such information to a taxpayer for accurate filing of his return of income. \n● The Finance Act 2022 has also introduced specific provisions for the taxation of virtual digital assets (VDA), where the transfer of VDA is to be taxed at the rate of 30% with no deduction in respect of expenditure (other than the cost of acquisition) to be allowed. Moreover, loss from the transfer of virtual digital assets cannot be set off from any other income and cannot be carried forward to subsequent years. Further, the transfer of VDA is subject to TDS of 1% of the transaction value (whether in cash/ kind/ both). The gift of VDA would also be taxed in the hands of the recipient. \n● Deduction of tax at source on benefit or perquisite in respect of business or profession has also been introduced in Finance Act 2022 to widen and deepen the tax base. A person providing any benefit or perquisite to a resident would deduct TDS of 10% of the value or aggregate of the value of such benefit or perquisite (whether in cash/kind/ both). \n● Finance Act 2022 has provided that no set off of any loss shall be allowed against undisclosed income detected during search and survey operations to bring certainty and increase deterrence among tax evaders.\n● Vide Finance Act 2022, provisions applicable to bonus stripping have also been made applicable to securities. It has also been provided that the provisions on bonus stripping and dividend stripping shall also apply to units of an Infrastructure Investment Trust or a Real Estate Investment Trust, or units of Alternative Investment Funds.\nTax incentives\n● Finance Act 2022 has provided income tax relief to the amount received by a taxpayer for medical treatment from an employer or from any person for treatment of Covid-19 during FY 2019-2020 and subsequent years. Income-tax relief has also been provided to ex-gratia 72\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\npayment received from the employer/ other person by family members of a person who has \ndied on account of Covid-19 during FY 2019-2020 and subsequent years. \n● Tax relief has also been widened to the persons with disability. The payment of annuity and lump sum amount from insurance scheme is to be allowed to differently abled dependent during the lifetime of parents/guardians, i.e., on parents/ guardian attaining the age of 60 years or more and where such contribution to the scheme has been discontinued. \n● To bring parity between employees of State and Central government, the tax deduction limit on employer contribution has been increased from existing 10% to 14% of salary in NPS Tier-I Account for State Government employees as well. This would also help in enhancing social security benefits. \n● To promote start-ups, the Income Tax Act of 1961 allows for a deduction of 100% of the profit and gains of eligible start-ups for three consecutive years out of ten years. However, due to Covid-19, there have been delays in setting up such eligible businesses. To lend a supporting hand to these start-ups, the period of incorporation of the eligible start-up has been extended to 31.03.2023 vide Finance Act 2022.\n● To provide a level playing field between cooperative societies and companies, the alternate minimum tax rate paid by cooperatives has been reduced from 18.5% to 15%. Further, surcharge on cooperative societies has been reduced from 12% to 7% for those having total income of more than ₹1 crore and up to ₹10 crore.\n● For concessional tax regime to establish a globally competitive environment, the date of commencement of manufacturing or production of an article or thing for a newly established manufacturing entity for availing 15% concessional tax rate under section 115BAB of the Income-tax Act, 1961 has been extended from 31st March 2023 to 31st March 2024. \n● Over the past few years, several tax concessions have been provided to units located in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) under the Income-tax Act, 1961, to make it a global hub of the financial services sector. To further incentivise operations from IFSC, the following have been made exempt from tax subject to specified conditions vide Finance Act, 2022:\n i. Income of a non-resident from offshore derivative instruments\n ii. Income from over-the-counter derivatives issued by an offshore banking unit\n iii. Income from royalty and interest on account of the lease of a ship\n iv. Income received from portfolio management services in IFSC\nAnnexe 3: Measures by CBIC undertaken during FY23\nReform measures as regards customs:\n● The Customs duty rate structure has been guided by a conscious policy of the government to \nincentivise domestic value addition under Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative, which inter alia envisages imposition of lower duty on raw materials and providing reasonable tariff support to goods being manufactured in India. The customs duty structure has been calibrated to incentivise investment in key areas like petroleum exploration, 73\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\nelectronic manufacturing, etc. In accordance with this policy, the MFN rates of BCD have \nbeen increased in recent years on such items which are being manufactured in India or which domestic industry aspires to manufacture. Accordingly, during the last 6 years, about 4000 tariff lines (approximately 1/3rd of total tariff lines) have seen upward calibration of BCD. Such items include, metals, metal products, auto parts, footwear, fabrics, garments, specified chemicals, toys, certain machinery, medical equipment, a number of MSME items like bells, gongs, ceramic wares, table ware, utensils, hardware etc, consumer electronics and home appliances including mobile, TV , refrigerators, washing machine, AC, fans, heaters, hair dryers, shavers, toasters, ovens etc. At the same time, duties of inputs and raw materials have been rationalised. \n● Phased Manufacturing Plan (PMP) in respect of significant products like mobile phones, other electronic goods like TVs, electric vehicles, batteries, solar panel etc- The BCD rates in respect of different stages of the value chain of these products are calibrated in a manner that encourages gradual deepening of domestic value addition. For example, in respect of mobile phones, initially the parts were placed under nil BCD while duty was imposed on mobiles. Gradually, duty has been raised on parts in phased manner as their production began in India. \n● India stands fully compliant with all the commitments under WTO\'s Trade Facilitation Agreement. Compliance has been achieved well within the stipulated timeline of February 2022 and the same stands duly notified and acknowledged by the World Trade Organisation. The heartening results achieved can be evidenced from the significant improvements in the standings in the United Nation\'s Global Survey on Digital and Sustainable Trade Facilitation, wherein, India has witnessed a sustained improvement in the Trade Facilitation score to 90.32% in 2021 from 78.49% in 2019. India is the best performing country when compared with South and South West Asia (63.12%) region. \n● With the objective to enhance the uniformity in the physical examination process of EXIM cargo and reduce the time and cost involved in the process, CBIC has introduced Risk Management based uniform cargo examination orders at all Customs locations across the country, vide Circular No. 16/2022-Customs dated 29th of August, 2022.\n● Continuing with the trend to implement measures to facilitate taxpayers, CBIC has notified the Customs (Electronic Cash Ledger), Regulations, 2022 dated 30.03.2022 to enable the importer, exporter or any person liable to pay Customs duty, fees etc., to deposit an advance with the government instead of making transaction wise payment as was being done earlier. Such deposit can be utilised for payment of duties and other sums relating to Customs by seamlessly debiting the requisite amount from the ECL. Additionally, CBIC has launched an Anonymised Escalation Mechanism for handling the grievances related to delay in clearances. In the above mechanism, CBIC\'s ICEGATE registered users can submit their grievance for delayed clearances under faceless assessment and escalate it anonymously to the concerned assessing as well as the higher officers at relevant FAG Port (Faceless Assessment Group). The Anonymized Escalation facility also enables users to track the status of the grievances submitted by them till the final resolution. 74\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n● With an objective to utilise technology to optimise internal processes, CBIC has launched \na pilot project for implementation of Electronic Cargo Tracking System (ECTS) on 14.10.2021, based on blockchain technology for tracking movement of goods from the port to a warehouse at ICD Tughlakabad ensuring secured documentation & GPS based tracking of containers.\n● Indian Customs has notified IGCRS Rules, 2022 vide Notification 74/2022 dated 9th September, 2022 superseding the existing Customs (Import of Goods at Concessional Rate of Duty) Rules, 2017. These rules have come into effect from 10th September 2022. These rules have introduced significant changes for simplifying and automating the procedures for import of goods at concessional Rate of Duty in accordance with the larger goals of "Ease of doing business" by accommodating long standing demands from the trade such as inclusion of job work, clearance of capital goods at depreciated value, making the entire process simple and online and doing away with any need for physical interface with officers.\nChanges in Customs Law and Procedure:\n● As a trade facilitation measure, the validity of e-scrips issued under the Electronic Duty Credit Ledger Regulations, 2021, has been increased from one year to two years from the date of their generation. Further, the recovery provisions from the transferee holder of the e-scrips (issued under RoDTEP and RoSCTL schemes) and suspension of its credit account have also been omitted.\n● In order to leverage the vast network of post offices across the country and enable MSME\'s (Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) to export to global markets using e-commerce or other regular channels, the CBIC in collaboration with the Department of Posts (Dop) has notified the Postal Exports (Electronic Declaration and processing) Regulations, 2022. Under the new system, an exporter need not visit a Foreign post Office (FPO) to file the Postal Bill of Export (PBE) and present export parcel. Rather, he is enabled to file the PBE online from his home/office and handover the export parcel to postal authorities at a nearby booking post office. Postal authorities shall arrange secure transport of export parcel from booking post office to an FPO, where customs clearance shall take place.\n● Circular No.8/2022-Customs dated 17.5.2022 has been issued to enable exports from Bangladesh to India by rail in closed containers, with clearance at hinterland ICDs. A transshipment module has also been developed in the Indian Customs EDI system to digitise the procedure. This would decongest the border trade points and facilitate Bangladesh\'s exports.\n● Vide Circular No. 17/2022-Customs dated 9.9.2022, CBIC has enabled export of containerised cargo from any inland Container Depot (ICD) to Bangladesh using a combination of rail/road route and riverine route. For instance, the containerised cargo after customs clearance at an ICD shall be transported to Kolkata/Haldia port by rail or road, from where it shall be loaded on a barge for export to Bangladesh using riverine route. Customs clearance shall take place at the ICD and only preventive checks are conducted at Kolkata/Haldia. This facility is expected to help reduce congestion of export cargo at land Customs Stations.75\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\n● With a view to leveraging the potential of inland Waterways for enhancing trade and transit, \nCBIC has allowed movement of containerised export goods of Bangladesh through India using a combination of riverine and rail routes. This facility, allowed Vide Circular No. 19/2022-Customs dated 14.9.2022, involves entry of containerised cargo on a barge/vessel from Bangladesh into India up to the sea port of Kolkata or Haldia using the riverine route. From the sea port of Kolkata or Haldia, the goods will travel by rail to the sea port of Nhava Sheva or Mundra for final export to third countries by sea route. The Circular lays down detailed procedure and documentation and provides for track and trace facility using ECTS (Electronics Cargo Tracking System). This arrangement is expected to save time and cost for the traders by providing an alternate and more efficient trade route.\n● Vide Circular No. 09/2022-Customs dated 30.6.2022, CBIC has put in place a simplified regulatory framework for e-commerce exports of jewellery via international Courier Terminals (ICTs). To accommodate the e-commerce business need, it incorporates a re-import process for return of jewellery. For this purpose, the Courier import and export (Electronic Declaration and Processing) Regulations, 2010 have been amended vide Notification No. 57/2022-Customs (N.T) dated 30.6.2022. The simplified framework is applicable on e-commerce export of jewellery made of precious metals (whether or not studded or set with precious or semi-precious stones). This reform is aimed at supporting the Make-in-India brand in the international markets and enhancing the competitiveness of Indian jewellery exports leveraging the rapidly evolving global e-Market space.\nChanges in Excise Duty:\n● Retail selling prices of petrol and diesel in the country are linked to crude prices. The crude prices have been varying for the past few months. Indian basket is moving upwards and reached beyond $110 per barrel in May, 2022. The Dollar exchange rate was also on the upward trend and is hovering around ₹77 per USD, impacting the prices of Petrol and Diesel. The Retail selling price of petrol and diesel have risen from ₹95.41 per litre and ₹86.67 per litre respectively in March 2022 to ₹105.41 per litre and ₹96.67 per litre respectively on 21 May, 2022. This has necessitated a reduction in Excise Duty on petrol and diesel. Extensive deliberations were held at various stakeholders including Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and it was decided to rationalise Central Excise duty rates on Petrol and Diesel by ₹8 per litre on Petrol and ₹6 per litre on Diesel. The proposed reductions has been given effect to by reducing the Road and Infrastructure Cess (RIC).  \nChanges in GST (Rates):\n● In 2022, the following changes were made to GST rates on goods and services:\n● In the 47th GST Council meeting, it was decided to increase the GST rates on items such as Printing, writing or drawing ink, Power driven pumps primarily designed for handling water such as centrifugal pumps, Pawan Chakki, Drawing and marking out instruments, Solar Water Heater and system etc to correct inverted duty structure in these items. Similarly, GST rates on certain services such as Services supplied by foreman to chit fund, Job work in relation to processing of hides, skins and leather, Job work in relation to manufacture of leather goods and footwear etc were also calibrated to correct inverted duty structure. 76\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n● Hitherto, GST was exempted on specified food items, grains etc when not branded, or right \non the brand has been foregone. In the 47th GST Council Meeting, it has been decided to revise the scope of exemption to exclude from it prepackaged and pre-labelled retail pack in terms of Legal Metrology Act, including pre-packed, pre-labelled curd, lassi and butter milk.\n● With an objective to rationalise GST exemptions, the 47th GST Council Meeting recommended to withdraw GST exemption on items such as Cheques, lose or in book form, Maps and hydrographic or similar charts of all kinds, including atlases, wall maps, topographical plans and globes, printed. On similar lines, exemption in form of a concessional rate of GST is being rationalised on items such as Petroleum/ Coal bed methane, Scientific and technical instruments supplied to public funded research institutes, E-waste. \nChanges in GST Law and Procedure:\n● The following measures were undertaken for trade facilitation and ease of doing business under GST in 2022-23:\nmeasures intended to facilitate trade: \n● Retrospective amendment made in section 50 of CGST Act with effect from 01.7.2017 to provide the interest is required to be paid on the wrongly availed ITC only when the same has been availed as well as utilised. Also, rate of interest on wrongly availed and utilised ITC reduced to 18% from 24% with retrospective effect from 01.7.2017.\n● Vide Notification No. 14/2022-Central Tax dated 5.7.2022, UPI & IMPS have been provided as an additional mode for payment of GST to facilitate taxpayers and to further encourage digital payment by amending Rule 87(3) of CGST Rules. This will provide them flexibility and case in making their GST payment.\n● Transfer of CGST/IGST cash ledger balance has been allowed between \'distinct persons\' (entities having same PAN but registered in different states). Facility has been provided for withdrawal of refund applications made under GST by the taxpayers.\n● Facility has been provided for withdrawal of refund applications made under GST by the taxpayers.\n● In GST, a mechanism has been prescribed for refund of accumulated ITC on export of electricity.\n● Procedure of sanction of IGST Refund in case of export of goods, where the exporters have been identified as risky, has been streamlined, to expedite verification and processing of such claims.\nmeasures intended to improve ease of doing business:\n● Threshold for mandatory issuance of e-invoice has been reduced to ₹10 crore from 01.10.2022.\n● To facilitate small taxpayers in making supply of goods through e-commerce operators 77\nFiscal Developments- Revenue Relish\n(ECO), and to provide parity in intra-state offline and online supply of goods, in-principle \ndecision has been taken for waiver of requirement of mandatory registration under GST for intra-state supply of goods through ECO\'s Composition taxpayers would also be allowed to make intra-State supply through ECOs subject to certain conditions. This will open the huge e-commerce market for the small taxpayers to sell their goods without getting mandatory registration which will boost small business. These changes would be notified in due course of time, as it would require amendment in GST provision, as per recommendations of GST Council, and technical change on portal and also by ECOs.CHAPTER04\nThe year 2022 marked the return of high inflation, especially in advanced economies, \nafter nearly four decades. Inflation did not spare emerging economies either. These \ndevelopments led to an unprecedented, synchronous, and sharp cycle of monetary \ntightening across countries. Major central banks have implemented sharp increases in policy rates, with the Federal Reserve’ s rate hikes being the steepest since the 1970s. \nWhile the Federal Reserve has raised policy rates by 425 basis points (bps), the European \nCentral Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) have implemented 300 bps and 250 bps rate increases, respectively. The RBI initiated its monetary tightening cycle in \nApril 2022 and has since implemented a policy repo rate hike of 225 bps. Consequently, \ndomestic financial conditions began to tighten, which was reflected in the lower growth of monetary aggregates.\nThe change in RBI’ s policy stance in FY23 led to a moderation of surplus liquidity \nconditions that prevailed during the pandemic years. Monetary policy transmission is well underway as lending and deposit rates increased following the hike in policy rates. In \nthe government securities (G-sec) market, bond yields were on an upward trajectory until \nJune 2022 on concerns of high inflation and policy rate hikes. These yields moderated in November and December 2022, aided by lower crude oil prices, a slower pace of rate \nhikes, and general moderation in global sovereign bond yields. \nWhile the global tightening cycle has contributed to a dampened global outlook, the \ndomestic appetite for credit has been on an upswing. Non-food credit offtake by scheduled \nCommercial Banks (SCBs) has been growing in double digits since April 2022, with the \nincrease being broad-based. Credit disbursed by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) has also been on the rise. The balance sheet clean-up exercise has been vital in \nenhancing the lending ability of financial institutions. The Gross Non-Performing Assets \n(GNP A) ratio of SCBs has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.0, while the Capital-to-Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) remains healthy at 16.0 and well above the regulatory \nrequirement of 11.5. The health of NBFCs has continued to improve as well. The recovery \nrate for the SCBs through Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was highest in FY22 compared to other channels.  \nPolitical and economic developments in 2022 – the breakout of a conflict in Europe, \nhigh inflation and raising interest rates - meant that capital markets around the world were characterised by increased volatility. However, domestic capital markets displayed \nsome encouraging trends. The primary equity markets witnessed participation from all \nsegments, especially with increased Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contributions Monetary ManageMent \nand financial inter Mediation: a  good year79\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\nwhile primary private debt markets saw a growth in placements and resource mobilisation. \nWhile secondary capital market indices of the Nifty 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex were \nnot immune to the volatility in Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) flows, they performed \nbetter than their peers between April and December 2022. Furthermore, net FPI flows turned positive in the quarter ending December 2022. The indices have displayed a \ndecreasing trend in volatility as measured by the India Volatility Index (VIX) over this \nperiod. Both developments underscore India’ s strong macroeconomic fundamentals and relatively buoyant demand outlook.\nThe increasing outreach of the banking sector and capital markets is reflected in the \ninsurance and pension sectors. Insurance penetration in India has been steadily increasing, with life insurance penetration being above the emerging markets and global averages. \nImportant government interventions and a conducive regulatory environment have \nsupported the growth of the insurance market, which has seen increasing partnerships, product innovations, and vibrant distribution channels. India is poised to emerge as one \nof the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. The pension sector too has \nbeen taking rapid strides since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS), more recently, the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The sector has witnessed a robust increase \nin the number of subscribers and assets under management (AuM). The expansion of \nthe sector has been aided by government measures such as relaxation in CCS (Pension) Rules, integration of electronic Pension Payment Order (e-PPO) with DigiLocker, and \nrelaxation in the timeline for submitting Digital Life Certificate.\nAs global central banks reaffirm their hawkish stances and telegraph ‘higher-for-longer’ \npolicy rates in their battle against inflation, monetary conditions are expected to remain \ntight worldwide. Domestically, however, RBI’ s support to growth will ensure adequate \nliquidity in financial markets. The growth in credit offtake is expected to sustain, and combined with a pick-up in private Capex, will usher in a virtuous investment cycle. The \ncredit upcycle will also be aided by constant monitoring of the risks in the financial system \nby the regulators and their efforts to contain them. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals will underpin the return of global capital flows to India once the fog of uncertainty lifts. \nThe financial system will play a key role in realising the objectives of Amrit Kaal.\nMonetary developments\n4.1 Inflationary pressures dominated the global economic landscape in FY23. The build-up of \nprice pressures occurring in tandem with the economic recovery in FY22 from the pandemic was \nlong viewed as transient. It was expected to abate as supply chains normalised. The debate on said transience was put to rest by the conflict that erupted in Europe in February 2022. It resulted in commodity prices soaring and added significantly to the prevailing inflationary pressures. This development has triggered the current sharp and synchronous monetary tightening cycle.  Setting the context, this chapter will review India’s monetary developments and the performance of the financial system in the current financial year. It includes reviewing the monetary policy actions and their impact on system liquidity and evaluating the performance of the banking system, sectoral credit developments and various insolvency frameworks. Further, it looks into the capital market, insurance and pension sector developments.80\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n4.2 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained a status quo on the policy repo rate \nbetween May 2020 and February 2022 after implementing a 115 basis points (bps) reduction \nbetween March 2020 and May 2020. Retail inflation has crossed the upper limit of RBI’s tolerance band since January 2022. Sensing a serious risk to price stability, RBI initiated the monetary tightening cycle. In its April 2022 meeting, the committee introduced the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF), which allowed for the deposit of excess funds by banks with the RBI without the necessity of collateral in the form of government securities, thereby allowing effective liquidity management in a collateral-free manner. Here, it is worth mentioning that while the SDF window is available for overnight deposits, the Reserve Bank retains the flexibility to absorb surplus liquidity of longer tenors under the window, if necessary, with appropriate pricing. The SDF, introduced at a rate of 3.75 per cent, replaced the reverse repo rate as the new floor of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) corridor. The MPC also indicated a change in stance from ‘Accommodative’ to ‘Accommodative and focused on the withdrawal of accommodation, while supporting growth’ in this meeting, signalling the start of the monetary tightening cycle.\nfigure iV .1: Policy rates\n2.53.54.55.56.57.5\nFeb- 20\nApr-20\nJun- 20\nAug- 20\nO ct -20\nDe c-20\nFeb- 21\nApr-21\nJun- 21\nAug- 21\nO ct -21\nDe c-21\nFeb- 22\nApr-22\nJun- 22\nAug- 22\nO ct -22\nDe c-22Per centFixed Reverse repo rate Repo rate  SDF rate MSF rate\nSource: RBI\n4.3 Recognising the sizeable upside risk imparted by adverse global developments, such as \nthe generalised hardening of commodity prices and an increased likelihood of prolonged supply \nchain disruptions, the MPC convened an off-cycle meeting in May 2022. Members unanimously voted for an increase of 40 bps each in the policy repo rate, the SDF and the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF), and a 50 bps increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR). Between May 2022 and December 2022 and over five meetings, the MPC implemented a cumulative hike of 225 bps each in the policy repo rate, the SDF, the MSF and the bank rate. In the initial phases of the tightening cycle, the committee noted that commodity price-driven inflationary pressures, increased volatility and initial signs of a slowdown in output characterised the global outlook. In its latest meeting of December 5-7 2022, the MPC hiked the policy repo rate by 35 bps, and reiterated its focus on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.  81\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\n4.4 Reserve money (M0) increased by 10.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) as on 30th  December \n2022 compared to 13 per cent last year. However, reserve money adjusted for the first-round \nimpact of changes in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) recorded a YoY growth of 7.8 per cent compared to 9.1 per cent a year ago. On the component side, growth in Currency in Circulation (CIC) broadly remained stable at levels seen after Covid-19, barring a marginal increase in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which can be attributed to a rise in precautionary holdings. So far, expansion in M0 during FY23 was mainly driven by bankers’ deposits with the RBI, with an increase in the CRR.\ntable iV .1: yoy growth in monetary aggregates (in per cent)\nitem fy17^ fy18 fy19 fy20 fy21 fy22 fy23*\n1. reserve Money (M0) -12.9 27.3 14.5 9.4 18.8 13.0 10.3\n1.a.

From \nthe component side, aggregate deposits have been the largest component and contributed most \nto the expansion of M3 during the year so far. Amongst sources, bank credit to the commercial sector drove the expansion of broad money, and net bank credit to the government supplemented this expansion. Of significance is the increase in the share of bank credit to the commercial sector in M3 to 64.3 per cent as on 30th December 2022 from 61.1 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year, reflecting the upswing in the credit disbursal by commercial banks.\n4.6 The money multiplier – the ratio of M3 and M0 – has broadly remained stable at an \naverage of 5.1 over April – December 2022 period compared to 5.2 in the corresponding period \nof the previous year. However, M0 adjusted for reverse repo, which is analytically akin to banks’ deposits with the RBI, was much higher until April 2022. Hence, the adjusted money multiplier was lower at 4.3 at the beginning of FY23. M0 adjusted for the reverse repo is now much closer to M0; hence, as on 30 December 2022, the money multiplier and adjusted money multiplier stood at 5.21 and 5.03, respectively. \nliquidity conditions\n4.7 Surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed post-Covid-19 in response to the Reserve Bank’s \nconventional and unconventional monetary measures moderated during FY23 in consonance with the changed monetary policy stance that focused on the withdrawal of accommodation. With the MSF rate retained at 25 bps above the policy repo rate, the LAF corridor became symmetric around the policy repo rate - the corridor width was thus restored to 50 bps, the position that prevailed before the pandemic. The RBI’s move to hike the CRR by 50 bps resulted in a withdrawal of primary liquidity to the tune of ₹87,000 crore from the banking system.\nliquidity conditions moderating\nfigure iV .3a: gradual withdrawal of  \nsurplus liquidityfigure iV .3b: overnight call money rates  \nnow trending well inside laf  corridor\n-11357\n01-Apr-22\n22-Apr-22\n13-May-22\n03-Jun-2224-Jun-22\n15-Jul-22\n05-Aug-22\n26-Aug-22\n16-Sep-22\n07-Oct-2228-Oct-22\n18-Nov-22\n09-Dec-22\n30-Dec-22₹ lakh croreNe t LAF\nDa ily SDF\nVariable Rate Reverse Repo\nMSF\n34567\n01-Apr-22\n22-Apr-22\n13-May-22\n03-Jun-2224-Jun-22\n15-Jul-22\n05-Aug-2226-Aug-22\n16-Sep-22\n07-Oct-2228-Oct-22\n18-Nov-22\n09-Dec-22\n30-Dec-22Per centWeighted average call rate\nFixed Reverse repo rate\nRepo rate\n SDF rate\nMSF rate\nSource: RBI83\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\n4.8 The daily net liquidity absorption averaged ₹2.5 lakh crore during FY23 (up to 21 December \n2022) as compared with ₹6.7 lakh crore in FY22. The Reserve Bank remained nimble and agile \nin liquidity management by conducting two-way operations. It injected liquidity to assuage transient liquidity tightness through two variable rate repo (VRR) auctions of ₹50,000 crore each of 3 days and overnight maturity on 26th July and 22nd September 2022, respectively. The gradual withdrawal of surplus liquidity pushed the weighted average call rate (WACR) – the operating target of monetary policy – closer to the policy repo rate, on an average basis. The WACR traded 6 bps above the policy repo rate, on an average, during H2 (up to 21 December 2022) compared to 28 bps below it during H1. Interest rates on various money market rates - 91-day Treasury Bills (T-Bills), 3-month certificates of deposit and commercial papers - gradually firmed up in line with the increase in the repo rate.\nMonetary Policy transmission\n4.9 Lending and deposit rates of banks increased during FY23 in consonance with the policy \nrepo rate changes. During FY23 (up to December 2022), external benchmark-based lending rate and 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) increased by 225 bps and 115 bps, respectively. Overall, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh and outstanding rupee loans rose by 135 bps and 71 bps, respectively, in FY23 (up to November 2022). On the deposit side, the weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on outstanding deposits increased by 59 bps in FY23 (up to November 2022).\nFigure IV .4: Transmission to domestic lending and deposit rates picking up\n357911\nJa n-19\nMar-19\nMay-19\nJul- 19\nSep- 19\nNov- 19\nJa n-20\nMar-20\nMay-20\nJul- 20\nSep- 20\nNov- 20\nJa n-21\nMar-21\nMay-21\nJul- 21\nSep- 21\nNov- 21\nJa n-22\nMar-22\nMay-22\nJul- 22\nSep- 22\nNov- 22Per centWALR - Outstanding rupee loans WALR  - Fresh rupee loans\n1-year median MCLR WADTDR - Outstanding rupee deposits\nPolicy Repo Rate\nSource: RBI\n4.10 An analysis of transmission across bank groups during FY23 (up to November 2022) \nindicates that the increase in the WALRs on fresh loans was higher in the case of public sector \nbanks, while that of the WADTDR on outstanding deposits and WALR on outstanding loans was higher for private banks.84\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nTable IV .2: Transmission to lending and deposit rates across bank groups\nVariation \nin bpsfebruary 2019 - March 2022 april to november 2022\nWalr - \noutstanding \nrupee \nloansWalr \n- fresh \nrupee \nloansWadtdr - \noutstanding \ndepositsWalr - \noutstanding \nrupee \nloansWalr \n- fresh \nrupee \nloansWadtdr - \noutstanding \ndeposits\nPSBs -153 -252 -169 59 149 51\nPVBs -141 -188 -211 82 101 59\nSCBs# -150 -232 -188 71 135 59\n^: March 31, 2017 over April 1, 2016, barring M0, CiC and Bankers\' Deposits with the RBI.      \n*: Data for FY23 is as on December 30, 2022\nSource: RBI\nNote: WALR: Weighted Average Lending Rate; WADTDR: Weighted Average Domestic Term Deposit Rate.\u2003\u2003\u2002MCLR: Marginal Cost of funds-based Lending Rate; \u2003\u2003\u2002# SCBs include public, private and foreign banks.\u2003\u2003\u2002PSBs: Public Sector Banks\u2003\u2003\u2002PVBs: Private Banks\nDevelopments in the G-sec Market\n4.11 After remaining steady through 2020 and 2021, the yield on the 10-year government bond \nrose in 2022. The weighted average yield spike reflects the domestic bond market volatility \nstemming from uncertainty in crude prices, a hawkish stance of major central banks, a hardening of global bond yield and the pressure on the rupee. The monthly average yield on the 10-year government bond stood at 7.3 per cent in December 2022 after having peaked at 7.5 per cent in June 2022. Yields moderated in November and December 2022 following smaller rate hikes by major central banks and declining inflation.

The GNPA ratio has decreased from 8.2 per cent in March 2020 to a seven-\nyear low of 5.0 per cent in September 2022, while Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA) have dropped to a ten-year low of 1.3 per cent of total assets. Lower slippages and the reduction in outstanding GNPAs through recoveries, upgrades and write-offs led to this decrease. Lower GNPAs, combined with high provisions accumulated in recent years, contributed to a decline in NNPA.  There was a broad-based improvement in the GNPA ratio in the industrial sector, though it remained elevated for gems and jewellery and construction sub-sectors. Going ahead, as per the baseline scenario of the RBI’s stress testing framework, the declining tendency in the GNPA ratio is likely to continue and is projected to drop further to 4.9 per cent in March 2023.\nfigure iV .7: Broad-based improvement in the gnP a ratio\n024681012\nAgriculture (23.0%) Industry (37.1%) Services (28.2%) Personal Loans (11.7%)Per centMar-21 Sep- 21 Mar-22 Sep- 22\nSource: RBI\nNote: Numbers in brackets with the legend represents share of the respective sector’s GNPA in total GNPA of SCBs as of Sept 2022.87\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\n4.16 Moreover, with shrinking GNPAs, the Provisioning Coverage Ratio (PCR) has been \nincreasing steadily since March 2021 and reached 71.6 per cent in September 2022. The CRAR \nof SCBs has been rising sequentially in the post-asset quality review period. With a pick-up in lending activity during H1:FY23, CRAR moderated in September 2022 because of an increase in risk-weighted assets (RWAs). However, it remains well above the minimum capital requirement, including Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) requirements of 11.5 per cent.\nfigure iV .8: capital adequacy ratio well above the requirement norms\n0510152025\nPSBs PVBs FBs SCBsPer centMar-20 Mar-21 Mar-22 Sep-22\n Source: RBI\n4.17 During the first half of FY23, the profitability of SCBs, measured in terms of Return \non Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA), improved to levels last observed in FY15. At \nthe system level, Profit After Tax (PAT) witnessed a double-digit growth of 40.7 per cent in the quarter ending September 2022, led by strong growth in Net Interest Income (NII) and a significant lowering of provisions. Macro-stress tests conducted by RBI for credit risk reveal that SCBs are well-capitalised and that all banks would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under adverse stress scenarios.\nconsistent improvement in Performance indicators\nfigure iV .9a: roe- annualised figure iV .9b: roa-annualised\n0481216\nPSBs PVBs FBs SCBsPer centMar-21 Sep-21 Mar-22 Sep-22\n0.00.40.81.21.62.0\nPSBs PVBs FBs SCBsPer centMar-21 Sep-21 Mar-22 Sep-22\nSource: RBI88\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nCredit Growth Aided by a Sound Banking System and Deleveraged Corporate \nSector\n4.18 The recovery in economic activity in FY22, along with the enhanced financial soundness \nof banks and corporates, has bolstered the expansion of non-food bank credit since June 2021. \nThe YoY growth in non-food bank credit accelerated to 15.3 per cent in December 2022.

An increase in demand for housing induces \ngreater investment which, in turn, sets off a virtuous cycle of growth and investment. Credit to agriculture and allied activities gained momentum supported by the Government’s concessional institutional credit and higher agricultural credit target. Industrial credit growth has been buoyed by a pick-up in credit to MSMEs, assisted by the benefits accrued from the effective 89\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\nimplementation of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and the support \nprovided by the government’s production-linked incentive scheme and improvement in capacity utilisation. Credit growth in services was driven by a recovery in credit to NBFCs, commercial real estate and trade sectors.\n4.20 With moderation in overseas issuances and lower investments by Private Equity (PE)/\nVenture Capital (VC), the financing needs of the corporate sector are being met through domestic \nresources.  As funds raised from the primary segment of domestic equity markets declined during FY23, reliance on bank credit for funding regular operations and capacity expansion increased. Also, the Incremental Credit-Deposit ratio rose sharply both on an annual (122.0 per cent, YoY) and half-yearly basis (172.5 per cent; September 2022 over March 2022). The accumulation of deposits in the past few years has enabled banks to fund the growing credit demand. Here, the well-capitalised banking system with a low NPA ratio and more robust corporate sector fundamentals will continue to enhance the flow of bank credit into productive investment opportunities, notwithstanding the rising interest rates.\nNon-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) Continue to Recover\n4.21 The growing importance of the NBFC sector in the Indian financial system is reflected \nin the consistent rise of NBFCs’ credit as a proportion to GDP as well as in relation to credit extended by SCBs. Supported by various policy initiatives, NBFCs could absorb the shocks of the pandemic. They built up financial soundness during FY22, marked by balance sheet consolidation, improvement in asset quality, augmented capital buffers and profitability.\nfigure iV .12: increasing credit disbursed to and by nBfcs\n0123456\n05101520253035\nFY13 FY15 FY17 FY19 FY21 H1:FY23\nPer cent₹ Lakh CroreAggregate Credit by NBFCs Credit to NBFCs (% of G DP, RHS)\nSource: RBI\nNote: Credit to NBFCs (per cent of GDP) for FY23 (H1) is estimated based on NSO’s 1st AE for FY23 and credit by NBFCs as of September 2022.\n4.22 The continuous improvement in asset quality is seen in the declining GNPA ratio of \nNBFCs from the peak of 7.2 per cent recorded during the second wave of the pandemic (June \n2021) to 5.9 per cent in September 2022, reaching close to the pre-pandemic level.

The decline of 20 bps was mainly because of an increase in RWA as lending picked up. The RoA has recouped over successive half-years.

The fear of losing control over the CD upon initiation of CIRP \nhas nudged thousands of debtors to settle their dues even before the initiation of insolvency proceedings. Until September 30 2022, 23,417 applications for initiation of CIRPs of CDs having underlying default of ₹7.3 lakh crore were disposed of before their admission into CIRP. \n69 per cent of the distressed assets rescued, realisation value around 178 per cent of the \nliquidation value\n4.28 Until September 30, 2022, 553 CIRPs have ended in resolution. Despite the very low value \nof the distressed firms to begin with, 69 per cent of distressed assets were rescued by the Code. \nOverall, in terms of value realisation for initiators of CIRPs (which includes Financial Creditors, Operational Creditors and Corporate Debtors), the resolution plans realised ₹2.4 lakh crore, which is 177.6 per cent of the liquidation value and 84\n1 per cent of the fair value of the 553 CDs \nrescued. Moreover, realisation by financial creditors under resolution plans in comparison to liquidation value was 201 per cent, while the realisation by them was 33 per cent of their claims. \n92 per cent of the value realised under the liquidation Process\n4.29 1807 CDs ended up with orders for liquidation as of September 2022. These CDs assets \nwere valued at less than 8 per cent of the aggregate claim amount on the ground. However, \nmore than 76 per cent of the CIRPs ending in liquidation (1349 out of 1774 for which data are available) were earlier with the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and/ or are defunct. The economic value of most of the corporate debtors that ended in liquidation had almost completely eroded even before they were admitted into CIRP. 429 CDs have been completely liquidated. The Code has facilitated the realisation of 92 per cent of the value through the liquidation of these companies.\nTable IV .4: Rescue of distressed assets as on 30th September  (Amount in ₹ crore)\nrescue of distressed assetscompanies \nrescued by \nresolutioncompanies \nordered for \nliquidationtotal\nNo. of Companies 553 1807 2360\nAggregate Claims 7,90,626 8,28,180 16,18,806\nLiquidation Value 1,37,119 60,143 1,97,261\nAssets available as % of \nAggregate Claims17.3 7.3 12.19\nResolution Value 2,43,452 NA 2,43,452\nResolution Value as % of \nLiquidation Value177.6 NA NA\nResolution Value as % of Aggregate Claims30.8 NA NA\nAverage time taken 561 days 437 days NA\nCost % of Resolution Value 0.6 NA NA\nSource: IBBI\n1  Based on 456 cases where fair values have been estimated94\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n2  Section 9.2.2 Mode of Sale https://ibbi.gov.in/uploads/publication/e42fddce80e99d28b683a7e21c81110e.pdf\n3  Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India for the year ended March 31, 2022NPAs: IBC recovers highest amount for Scheduled Commercial Banks\n4.30 As per the RBI data, in FY 22, the total amount recovered by SCBs under IBC has been \nthe highest compared to other channels such as Lok Adalat’s, SARFAESI Act and DRTs in this \nperiod.\n4.31 In a public auction-based resolution model2 such as the IBC, the extent of the haircut \nrepresents the discount the market demands for acquiring the stressed entity as a going concern. \nSince significant value destruction may have already happened in these assets, a comparison of realised value with admitted claims may not be a reasonable indicator of the effectiveness of the resolution process. Further, the rate of recovery is contingent on several factors, including the overall macroeconomic environment, perceived growth prospects of the entity and its sector, and the extent of erosion in the intrinsic value of the entity.

While \ncrypto assets were apparently designed to disintermediate traditional financial services, this has \ncreated new unregulated intermediating entities. The promise of decentralisation haslso yet to be realised in practice. New centralised intermediaries, such as crypto asset exchanges, wallet providers, \nand crypto conglomerates, require users to trust centralised entities. The increasing importance of \nthese entities could force regulators to consider them as systemic financial market infrastructures \n(FMIs)\n6. Still, the fact that they are yet largely unregulated is a cause for concern globally.\n4   Source:https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/how-cryptos-meltdown-changed-the-regulatory debate/2023/01/07/4a469c9a-8e51-11ed-\nb86a-2e3a77336b8e_story.html\n5   Joint Statement by Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230103a1.pdf\n6    As per Bank of International Settlements, Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) is defined as a multilateral system among participating \ninstitutions, including the operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling, or recording payments, securities, derivatives, or other financial transactions. As per RBI, the term FMI104\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nInterestingly, holdings of crypto assets are primarily concentrated in the hands of a few “whales”. \nEstimates show that around 85 per cent of all circulating Bitcoins are held by 4.5 per cent of entities \n(Ben Mariem et al., 2020). The underlying protocols used to create crypto assets may also conflict \nwith other public policy objectives, for instance, the massive energy intensity of “mining” crypto assets.\nThere are minimal global standards applicable to unbacked crypto assets, which do not currently \nmitigate all risks and vulnerabilities. Even as Standard-Setting Bodies (SSBs) have been making efforts to adjust and develop standards, these remain mainly focused on specific issues (financial integrity), \nsectors (payments, securities and banking), products (global stablecoins), or entities designated as \nsystemic by domestic authorities. Thus, there are regulatory gaps at each stage when crypto assets \nare issued, transferred, exchanged, or stored by non-bank entities. Crypto’s cross-sector and cross-\nborder nature limits the effectiveness of uncoordinated national approaches. The terminology used to describe the different activities, products, and stakeholders is not globally harmonised. The term \n“crypto asset” itself refers to a broad spectrum of digital products that may need the attention of \nmultiple domestic regulators based on their actual or intended use. There is a range of crypto actors, such as miners, validators, and protocol developers, that may not be easily covered by traditional financial regulation (Narain & Moretti, 2022).\nA few case studies\n7 of countries and jurisdictions attempting to regulate unbacked crypto assets are \ndiscussed below:\n\uf06c       european Union: The European Union’s digital finance strategy comprises regulating Markets \nin Crypto Assets (MiCA). Even as the focus is on stablecoins, for other crypto assets and key \nentities delivering critical functions such as exchanges and wallet providers, MiCA proposes \nonshoring, notification and licensing regimes.\n\uf06c     Japan: The Japan Financial Services Agency introduced regulation of crypto asset service providers in April 2017, mandating clients’ asset segregation, operational risk and cyber security \nmanagement, Know-Your-Customer, internal audits, and minimum capital requirements. This \nwas implemented by amending the Payment Service Act. Further amendments to the law were made in May 2019 and June 2020 to extend crypto regulation to other entities, such as wallet \nservice providers, limit the leverage provided to retail customers by crypto asset exchanges, \nand introduce regulations for security tokens and stablecoins, respectively. The law for partial \namendment to the Payment Services Act, etc. was enacted in June 2022 to establish a stable and \nefficient funds settlement system and to provide for the regulation of stablecoins.\n\uf06c     Switzerland: The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) issued guidelines for initial coin offerings in February 2018. Three categories of tokens were introduced: payment \ntokens, utility tokens, and asset tokens (with a clarification that tradable tokens at pre-financing \nand presale stage could be treated as securities). Subsequently, the Financial Services Act harmonised prospectus requirements across all securities (including asset tokens) in June 2018. \nThe distributed ledger technology (DLT) amended various civil and financial market laws in \nFebruary 2021 to enable the introduction of ledger-based securities on blockchain and provide \nrules for the segregation of crypto assets in the event of bankruptcy of crypto custodians.\n7    generally refers to systemically important payment systems, Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), Securities Settlement Systems (SSSs), \nCentral Counter Parties (CCPs), and Trade Repositories (TRs) that facilitate the clearing, settlement, and recording of financial transactions.IMF Fintech Notes, ‘Regulating the Crypto Ecosystem: The Case of Unbacked Crypto Assets’; https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fintech-notes/Issues/2022/09/26/Regulating-the-Crypto-Ecosystem-The-Case-of-Unbacked-Crypto-Assets-523715105\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\n\uf06c   United Kingdom: Financial Conduct Authority’s “Final Guidance on Crypto assets” declared in \nJune 2019 that while security tokens (crypto assets with rights and obligations similar to “specified \ninvestments”) fell inside the regulatory purview, utility and “exchange tokens” (i.e., unbacked \ncrypto assets) were outside of prudential and conduct regime. Following significant consumer research on the crypto asset market, the UK Treasury set out its roadmap for crypto asset regulation \nin April 2022, focusing on stablecoins and a proposal for a sandbox regime for blockchain-based \nFMIs. Regarding regulating crypto asset promotions, the UK Crypto Assets Taskforce\n8  published \na report in 2018 that found that misleading advertising (overstating benefits and rarely warning \nretail investors of volatility and risks) and lack of suitable information were vital consumer \nprotection issues in crypto-asset markets. In January 2022, the UK Treasury proposed bringing crypto assets within its Financial Promotions Regime, subjecting crypto asset promotions to \nthe same high standards as for other financial promotions such as stocks, shares, and insurance \nproducts. Similarly, the Monetary Authority of Singapore published guidelines to restrict the \nmarketing of crypto assets in Singapore in January 2022, limiting crypto asset promotions to an \nentity’s corporate website, official social media accounts, and mobile applications.\n\uf06c     albania: Albania’s law on “DLT-based Financial Markets” (also known as the “Fintoken Act”) \nlegalised crypto assets in Albania for investment purposes in May 2020. The regulation encompasses \nthe issuance of digital tokens and virtual currencies and the licensing, monitoring, and supervision \nof entities engaged in distribution, trading, and custody. The Albanian Financial Supervisory Authority (AFSA) and the National Agency for Information Society (NAIS) are entrusted as \ncompetent authorities for unbacked crypto assets (and the Bank of Albania for stablecoins). It may \nbe noted that licensing crypto asset service providers heavily relies on third-party agents, licensed \nas ‘Digital Token Agents’ when focusing on regulatory and financial compliance side by AFSA \nand as ‘Innovative Service Providers’ when dealing with technological compliance by NAIS.\n\uf06c     nigeria:  The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) declared in February 2018 that crypto assets are not \nlegal tender in Nigeria. Further, in February 2021, the CBN wrote to regulated financial institutions \nthat dealing in crypto assets and facilitating payments for crypto asset service providers was \nprohibited. More recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission published “New Rules on Issuance, Offering Platforms and Custody of Digital Assets,” outlining “digital asset offerings” as \nwithin the purview of the SEC and imposing requirements on “digital asset offering platforms” \nand “digital asset offering custodians” in May 2022.\nDespite some progress through the AML/CFT obligations for crypto asset providers stipulated \nby FATF, their implementation is still a work in progress (FATF 2021),\n9  with significant delays \nin critical areas such as the “travel rule,” leaving the virtual asset (V A) and virtual asset service providers (V ASP) sector vulnerable to criminal and terrorist misuse\n10. As of March 2022, while \n29 out of 98 responding jurisdictions reported having passed Travel Rule legislation, only 11 jurisdictions have started enforcement and supervisory measures.\nTherefore, Global standards need to be comprehensive and consistent; regulatory responses must \nbe based on standard taxonomies, reliable data to address contagion effects, and flexible enough \nto be adjusted in the future based on market developments and future international standards. \n  8  The ‘UK Crypto Asset Taskforce’ comprises HM Treasury, Bank of England, and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)\n  9  FATF, “Second 12-month Review Virtual Assets and V ASPs,” FATF, (Paris, France 2021).10   FATF, “Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets/V ASPs,” FATF, (Paris, France 2022).106\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nifSc – gift  city\n4.50 Over the last few years, various initiatives taken by the government have opened up new \navenues and opportunities for capital market players.

Box 2 below discusses the key role that IFSC can play in facilitating India’s emergence as a preferred jurisdiction for international financial services and encouraging easier access and greater participation from foreign investors to bring in capital to further promote India’s growth.\nBox iV .2: gift  ifSc - emerging as a Preferred Jurisdiction \nfor international financial Services\nGlobally, International Financial Centres (IFCs) have assumed prominence in the financial services \necosystem primarily because they have contributed enormously to the growth of international \nfinancial transactions. These centres have played a pivotal role in accelerating the pace of financial \nglobalisation. In common parlance, an IFC is a jurisdiction with a high concentration of financial institutions such as Banks, Stock Markets & related entities, Insurance firms, Fund Managers, \nFinTech firms, etc., which offer specialised financial services to non-residents and residents, in an \nenvironment that promotes financial innovation and facilitates cross border transactions.\nGiven this backdrop, setting up and operationalising India’s maiden IFSC in GIFT City has been \na path-breaking financial reform underpinning India’s increasingly liberal outlook towards capital \naccount convertibility. GIFT-IFSC is housed in India’s first fully operational Smart City with world-class commercial, social and physical infrastructure. To bolster the development of IFSC, the \nGovernment took a major policy decision to establish the first of its kind, unified and agile financial \nsector regulator for IFSCs viz International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) through an Act of Parliament in 2019. From 1st October 2020, IFSCA assumed the power of four domestic sector \nregulators, namely RBI, SEBI, IRDAI & Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of \nIndia (PFRDAI), in so far as the development and regulation of IFSCs in India were concerned.  \nOver the last two years, GIFT-IFSC has witnessed tremendous growth and traction across the entire \nspectrum of financial services, including banking, capital markets, insurance, fund management, \naircraft leasing, etc. With an internationally aligned regulatory regime, competitive tax structure and \nbeneficial cost of operations, GIFT IFSC is now emerging as a preferred jurisdiction for international financial services. Recognising the growing significance of IFSC, the Global Financial Centres Index, \nLondon Report (March 2022) put IFSC in GIFT City at the top, among 15 centres globally, which is \nlikely to become more significant over the next 2 to 3 years.\nGIFT IFSC has more than 390 + entities registered across a full spectrum of financial services, \nincluding Banks, Capital Markets, Insurance, FinTech, Aircraft Leasing, Bullion Exchange, etc. \nThe financial services market is rapidly growing with the healthy and increasing participation of international and domestic financial institutions. \nrecent developments/milestones/innovations/collaborations with other countries\nIn pursuit of its vision to become an international financial centre of global stature, IFSCA has \ncontinuously engaged in deliberations with many globally prominent financial authorities and \nstandard-setting bodies. To date, the Union Cabinet has approved the signing of 2 Multilateral MoUs107\nMonetary Management And Financial Inter Mediation: A Good Year\n(MMoU) and 7 Bilateral MoUs (BMoUs) by IFSCA to deepen cooperation with foreign regulators \nand aid the mutual exchange of information for the development of financial products and services \nin GIFT-IFSC. The table below provides the latest status of MoUs approved by the Union Cabinet – \nMultilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU)\n\uf06cInternational Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) \n\uf06cInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS)\nBilateral Memorandum of Understanding (BMoU)\n\uf06cDubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) \n\uf06cQatar Financial Services Authority (QFCA)\n\uf06cAbu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA)\n\uf06cAutorite Des Marches Financiers of France (AMF)\n\uf06cCommission De Surveillance Du Secteur Financier (CSSF) Luxembourg\n\uf06cFinansinspektionen (FI) Sweden.\n\uf06cMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\nBesides the above, IFSCA has also entered into agreements for technical cooperation and capacity \nbuilding for the development of a world-class regulatory environment for financial products and \nfinancial services in IFSC. Some of the projects/agreements showcasing IFSCA’s growing engagement \nwith the global community are highlighted below: \nfint ech bridge with the Monetary authority of Singapore\nBoth India and Singapore have been pioneers in the FinTech sector. To fuel the next phase of FinTech \ngrowth, the Government of India is developing GIFT IFSC as the nerve centre of all FinTech \nactivities. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) have signed a FinTech Co-operation Agreement (CA) to facilitate regulatory \ncollaboration and partnership in FinTech to promote a Joint Regulatory Sandbox Collaboration that \nwill leverage existing regulatory sandboxes in their respective jurisdictions to support experimentation of technology innovations. The Agreement will enable FinTech firms from one jurisdiction to gain \nmarket access in the other jurisdiction through a regulatory referral system.\nnSe ifSc -SgX connect\nNSE IFSC-SGX Connect, inaugurated by the PM on July 29, 2022, is an essential milestone in the \ncross-border collaboration between India and Singapore in the area of capital markets. The Connect, \nlikely to be fully operational by June 2023, will play a pivotal role in onshoring derivative trading \nin NIFTY Products from SGX, Singapore, to NSE-IFSC, GIFT City. The Connect is expected to consolidate volumes and deepen liquidity in derivative instruments at GIFT IFSC, bring in more \ninternational participants and positively impact other financial ecosystems in GIFT IFSC. It has been \ndesigned to harness the advantages of respective exchanges, SGX for ease of access to investors and NSE IFSC for trading and clearing derivative contracts, in a symbiotic manner to confer gains on all. \nVisibility and Mindshare among fint echs globally\nTo promote the FinTech ecosystem at GIFT IFSC and create visibility amongst the Global FinTech \ncommunity, IFSCA, with support from GoI, has instituted a flagship financial technology and global \nthought leadership event, “InFinity Forum” as an annual feature beginning in 2021. It unites the world’s108\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nleading minds in policy, business, and technology to discuss and develop actionable insight into how \nthe FinTech industry can leverage technology and innovation for inclusive growth. The first edition \nof the Forum held on the 3rd and 4th of December 2021, was inaugurated by the Prime Minister, with \nIndonesia, South Africa and the United Kingdom participating as partner countries. The event saw a total of 94,300 registrations, leaving behind a massive international footprint. \nCooperation agreement between India INX and Luxembourg Stock Exchange\nIndia INX, an IFSC-based exchange, signed a cooperation agreement with Luxembourg Stock \nExchange on June 01, 2022. The two exchanges will endeavour to enhance the visibility of listed \nIndian securities towards international investors by facilitating the admission of such securities listed on LuxSE. The Agreement builds on the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the \ntwo institutions in November 2020, which focuses on advancing green finance in India. The green \ncorridor opportunity established with this dual listing cooperation agreement between India INX and \nLuxSE will go a long way in attracting more issuers from India and the region and provides access to \ngreen capital from international investors.\nifSca  Vision for fy24 and beyond\nFY23 is a watershed year for IFSC.Use of technology, such as, web-based Inspection has been introduced in order to ensure transparency and accountability in enforcement.

Accordingly, Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) has developed eShram portal for creating a National database of unorganised workers, which is verified with Aadhaar. It captures details of workers like name, occupation, address, occupation type, educational qualification, and skill types etc., for the optimum realisation of their employability and extend the benefits of the social security schemes to them. It is the first-ever national database of unorganised workers, including migrant workers, construction workers, gig and platform workers, etc.Currently, e-Shram portal has been linked to NCS portal and ASEEM portal for seamless facilitation of services.\n6.20\u2003As on 31 December 2022, total over 28.5 crore unorganised workers have been registered \non eShram portal.

It connects the Government and the individual, replacing the disentangled web of multiple IDs for multiple purposes, and secures the social contract between the State and the Citizen. It is because of the initiative taken in 2010 that today, the nation is consistently building and strengthening a digital economy which will ultimately give a global competitive advantage in how money and goods move around the country over its competitors. \n6.22\u2003Paul Romer, a Nobel laureate and former World Bank Chief Economist, has described \nwhat 135 crore citizens of India, which is 94 per cent of the population and 100 per cent of the adult (>18 years), have as “the most sophisticated ID programme in the world.”\n11 Aadhaar \nprovides a conclusive connection between the photograph of the Aadhaar holder, his/her fingerprints, and iris scan details.\nachievements of aadhaar\n6.23\u2003Aadhaar is an essential tool for social delivery by the State. 318 Central schemes and over 720 state DBT schemes are notified under section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and all these schemes use Aadhaar for targeted delivery of financial services, subsidies, and benefits. Aadhaar is the foundation of India’s digital integration, as shown by the following statistics (as of November 2022):\n• Aadhaar Generated- 135.2 crore \n11\u2002“\'Adhaar\' most sophisticated ID programme in the world: World Bank”. Daiji World, Quoted from an interview with Bloomberg.156\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n• Aadhaar Updated- 71.1 crore\n• Authentication Done- 8621.2 crore\n• eKYC Done-1350.2 crore\n• 75.3 crore residents have linked their Aadhaar with ration cards to avail of ration\n• 27.9 crore residents linked Aadhaar with cooking gas connection for LPG subsidy\n• 75.4 crore bank accounts are linked with Aadhaar & 1549.8 crore transactions via Aadhaar \nEnabled Payment Systems\n6.24\u2003The key usages of Aadhaar in the daily lives of citizens are:\n• Aadhaar – Usage in DBT: When linked with a bank account, an Aadhaar becomes the \n‘Financial Address’ of an individual, which helps to accomplish the country’s goal of \nfinancial inclusion. The number is sufficient to transfer any payment to an individual’s bank account through Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB), thus eliminating the need to give other details, viz. the bank account, IFSC Code, and bank branch details to the Government/Institutions. \n• Aadhaar Enabled Payment Systems (AEPS): AEPS helps an individual to do basic banking transactions, viz. withdrawal, cash deposit, transfer of funds from his bank account, etc., by simply using his Aadhaar. This has immensely facilitated providing door-step banking services and helped mitigate the hardships of the people due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n• JAM (Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile) trinity, combined with the power of DBT, has brought the marginalised sections of society into the formal financial system, revolutionising the path of transparent and accountable governance by empowering the people. Till November 2022, multiple large central schemes, including PAHAL, MGNREGS, etc., have paid over \n`7,66,055.9 crore through over 1,010 crore successful transactions.12\n• One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) Scheme: Aadhaar has played a key role in the \nimplementation of the ONORC Scheme. While Aadhaar seeding of the PDS database has resulted in significant savings due to eliminating ghost and duplicate beneficiaries. Grain disbursal through Aadhaar-based Biometric Authentication has brought meaningful transparency and back-office improvement of the logistic network of PDS. Free distribution of food grains under ‘Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana’ (PMGKY) has greatly mitigated the Covid pandemic’s impact, especially for the weakest and most vulnerable sections of society.\n• PM Kisan Samman Nidhi: Aadhaar platform forms the backbone for the implementation of this scheme, right from registration through Aadhaar eKYC to DBT through the APB. \n• Co-WIN: Successful management of the Covid pandemic without the Co-WIN platform \nwould not have been possible. Aadhaar played a vital role in developing the Co-WIN platform and in the transparent administration of over 2 billion vaccine doses.\n12\u2002Source: National Payments Coporation of India.157\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\n• Face Authentication:  The use of face as an additional modality of authentication is \nincreasing. This has helped, especially the elderly, to get ‘Jeevan Praman’ through their \nsmartphones to avail of pension.\nthe aadhaar ecosystem\n6.25\u2003The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is mandated to develop the policy, procedure, and system for issuing an Aadhaar number to each resident individual and performing authentication. It also has the responsibility to take necessary measures to ensure that the information stored in the Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR) is secured and protected against unauthorised access or misuse. The ecosystem required for the purpose now consists of the following (as of 30 November 2022):\n• 66,103 Aadhaar counters and 34,834 Child Enrolment Lite Client devices are functional\n• 180 Active Registrars\n• 507 Active Enrolment Agencies\n• UIDAI run 88 Aadhaar Sewa Kendra are functional in 72 cities\n• 15,002 Village Level Entrepreneurs operational as Banking Correspondents permitted to \nundertake Aadhaar updates services\n• Around 53,750 postmen/Grameen Dak Sewaks under India Post Payment Bank have been approved to provide mobile number update facility\n• 178Aadhaar User Agencies\n• 169 e-KYC user agencies\nimproving employment t rends\n6.26\u2003Employment trends can be studied from the supply side of labour through household surveys such as the PLFS conducted by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), and the demand side of labour through enterprise or establishment surveys such as the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) by MoSPI, Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) by Labour Bureau, etc. These enable a complete view of the labour market and the trends therein.\n6.27\u2003The broad-based improvement in employment indicators can be observed in data covering \nboth the supply side and demand side of the labour market. Labour markets have recovered beyond pre-Covid levels, in both urban and rural areas, with unemployment rates falling from 5.8 per cent in 2018-19 to 4.2 per cent in 2020-21, and a noticeable rise in rural FLFPR from 19.7 per cent in 2018-19 to 27.7 per cent in 2020-21. More recent urban employment data shows progress beyond pre-pandemic levels as the unemployment rate declined from 8.3 per cent in July-September 2019 to 7.2 per cent in July-September 2022.\nThe net addition to EPFO payroll is steadily moving upward, with the majority share coming \nfrom the youth. Employment in nine major sectors has increased by 10 lakh over the year 2021-22 as per the QES. Employment in the organised manufacturing sector has also been rising over the years, as per the ASI 2019-20 data. The steady increase in employment levels can be attributed to multiple measures taken to cushion the impact of Covid-19 on MSMEs, 158\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nstreet vendors, and manufacturing units and provide job opportunities through various targeted \nschemes and measures as detailed in later in the chapter.

An upturn in the FLFPR (rising by 9.5 percentage points (pp) in 2017-18 to 2020-21 for usual status and by 8.3 pp for CWS) is a positive development on the gender aspect of employment, which could be attributable to rising rural amenities freeing up women’s time, and high agricultural growth over the years.

Measurement of employment through the survey \ndesign and content can make a significant difference to final LFPR estimates, and this matters more \nfor measuring female LFPR than male LFPR. Here, three main measurement issues have been highlighted: overly broad categories, reliance on a single question to categorize labour force status, \nand the narrow approach of limiting productive work to labour force participation.\nuse of overly broad categories clubbing productive work (collection of firewood, poultry \nfarming, etc.) with domestic duties can in one sweep shift a significant proportion of women in the \nlabour force into the out-of- labour-force category. For example, unless the production of primary \ngoods is identified as the main activity by the respondent, the PLFS questionnaire would categorize \nwomen who do both domestic activities and primary goods production/collection into ‘Activity Code \n93,\n19 and thus out-of-the-labour-force.\n19\u2002In the NSSO survey questionnaires, activity status codes are assigned to each household member, according to their primary activity under -\ntaken. Activity code 93 refers to “engaged in domestic duties and also engaged in free collection of goods (vegetable, firewood, cattle feed, \netc.), tailoring, etc. for household use”. 161\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\n\u2003\nAdding the proportion of women in Activity code 93 to the official LFPR yields an “Augmented \nFemale LFPR” of 46.2 per cent for FY21 for ages 15 years and above, much higher than the 32.5 \nper cent estimated by the conventional definition (PLFS data for usual status). A similar attempt has \nbeen made in an International Labour Organization (ILO) research paper20, arriving at a female LFPR \nof 56.4 per cent in India for 2012, against the far lower official estimate of 31.2 per cent for 2012.\n 32.546.2\n010203040506070\n1999-00 2004-05 2009-10 2011-12 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21per centFemale LFPR: Rural + Urban\nOfficial Augmented\nSource: NSS Employment Unemployment Survey (NSS-EUS) for 1999-00 to 2011-12, PLFS from \n2017-18 to 2011-12.Augmented FLPR calculations estimated using NSO dataNote: 1.

NSS-EUS and PLFS may not be comparable, given different sampling weights, frequencies, and data collection techniques.\nno recovery questions in the plfS questionnaire: The survey design relies mainly on a single \nquestion for measuring the labour force status of an individual, which eliminates the scope to rectify \nany error in self-reporting, considering the large rural population and literacy levels. Contrary to ILO \nrecommendations, there are no additional questions (‘recovery questions’) in the PLFS questionnaire to double-check individuals’ labour force status, relying too much on how the individual self-identifies \nin the first instance. ILO recommends using multiple probing or recovery questions such as “whether \nthe person helped in the family business” and “whether the person worked in own business in last one \nweek/year” and “whether person helped the family with job”.\nIn a World Bank and ILO study in Sri Lanka\n21, such methodological issues accounted for close to \neight percentage point underestimation of the female employment-to-population ratio.\nmeasurement of “Work” alongside “employment”: There is a need to broaden the horizon of \nmeasuring work, which constitutes the whole universe of productive activities alongside employment. According to the latest ILO standards\n22, limiting productive work to labour force participation is \n20\u2002Kapsos, S., Bourmpola, E., Silberman, A.

Measuring Women and Men’s Work: Main Findings from a Joint ILO and \nWorld Bank Study in Sri Lanka.\n22\u2002The 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 2013 adopted a new set of norms to expand the set of productive activities classi-\nfied as ‘work’, comprising any activity performed by persons of any sex and age to produce goods or to provide services for use by others or for \nown use. The definition of work is aligned with the General production boundary as defined in the System of National Accounts 2008, including own use production work and volunteer work.162\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nnarrow and only measures work as a market product. It does not include the value of women’s \nunpaid domestic work, which can be seen as expenditure-saving work such as collecting firewood, \ncooking, tutoring children, etc, and contributes significantly to the household’s standard of living. \nThus, a wholesome measurement of “work” may require improved quantification through redesigned surveys.\nThat said, there is further significant scope to nullify the gender-based disadvantages to enable \nfree choice of women to join the labour market. Ecosystem services, including affordable creches, career counselling/handholding, lodging and transportation, etc., can further help unlock the gender \ndividend for inclusive and broad-based growth.\n6.32\u2003It may be noted that more than 75 per cent of rural female workers are employed in \nthe agricultural sector. This implies a need to upskill and create employment for women in agriculture-related sectors such as food processing. Here, the self-help groups (SHGs) can play a crucial role in shaping rural women’s potential into concrete developmental outcomes of financial inclusion, livelihood diversification, and skill development as discussed in Box VI.3.\nbox Vi.3: role of Self-Help groups in Women’s empowerment\nThe Self-Help Groups (SHGs)23 movement, based on the principles of group solidarity and \nmicrofinance, has existed in India for 50 years in one form or another, with its roots tracing back to \nthe formation of the Self-Employed Women’s Association in 1972. The transformative potential of \nSHGs, exemplified through their key role in the on-ground response to Covid-19, has served as the fulcrum of rural development through women empowerment.\nIndia has around 1.2 crore SHGs, 88 per cent being all-women SHGs. Success stories include \nKudumbashree in Kerala, Jeevika in Bihar, Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahila Mandal in Maharashtra, and recently, Looms of Ladakh.\nThe SHG Bank Linkage Project (SHG-BLP), launched in 1992, has blossomed into the world’s \nlargest microfinance project. The SHG movement, now in its 30th year, has emerged as a powerful intervention to cover the small and marginalised sections. Currently, bank-linked SHGs are promoted \nthrough Central Government, State Governments, NGOs, etc. They must practice the ‘Panchasutra’ \nof regular meetings, regular savings, regular inter-loaning, timely repayment and up-to-date books of \naccounts to avail of loans from banks. With the active collaboration of stakeholders, the SHG-BLP \ncovers 14.2 crore families through 119 lakh SHGs with savings deposits of `47,240.5 crore and 67 \nlakh groups with collateral-free loans outstanding of `1,51,051.3 crore, as on 31 March 2022. The \nnumber of SHGs credit linked has grown at a CAGR of 10.8 per cent during the last ten years (FY13 to FY22), while credit disbursement per SHG has grown at a CAGR of 5.7 per cent during the same period. Notably, SHGs’ bank repayment is more than 96 per cent, underscoring their credit discipline \nand reliability.\n23\u2002A SHG is a socially and economically homogenous group of up to 20 persons, formed voluntarily for the collective purpose of savings and \ncredit, with no insistence on collateral for loans and end usage of credit. 163\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\ntable: progress under SHg-bank linkage programme\n(2019-20 to 2021-22)\n(Number in lakh/Amount in ` crore)\nparticulars2019-20 2020-21 2021-22\nno. of SHgs amount no. of SHgs amount no. of SHgs amount\nSHG \nSavings with Banks as of 31st MarchTotal SHG Nos. 102.4 \n(2.3) 26152.1 \n(12.1) 112.2  \n(9.6)37477.6 \n (43.3)118.9  \n(5.9)47240.5 \n(26.1)\nAll women SHGs (W)88.3 \n (3.5) 23320.6 \n(13.9) 97.3  \n(10.1)32686.1 \n(40.2)104.1 \n(7.0)42104.8 \n(28.8)\n% of W 86.2 89.2 86.7 87.2 87.5 89.1\nDAY-NRLM SHGs57.9  \n(3.8) 14312.7 \n(11.2) 64.8  \n(11.9)19353.7 \n(35.2)71.8  \n(10.9)27576.9 \n(42.5)\nLoans Disbursed to SHGs during the yearTotal No. of SHGs extended loans. 31.5 \n (16.6) 77659.4 \n(33.2) 28.9  \n(-8.2)58070.7 \n (-25.2)33.9 \n(17.7)99729.2 \n(71.7)\nAll women SHGs (W)28.8  \n(21.9) 73297.6 \n(37.6) 25.9  \n(-10.2)54423.1  \n(-25.8)31.5 \n(21.6)93817.2 \n(72.4)\n% of W 91.7 94.4 89.7 93.7 92.7 94.1\nDAY-NRLM SHGs20.5  \n(24.3) 52183.7 \n(56.2) 15.8  \n(-22.7)29643.0 \n (-43.2)22.9 \n(44.6)63100.8 \n(112.9)\n(Figures in parenthesis indicate the increase/decrease over the previous year)\nSource: NABARD\nimpact of SHgs: empowered Women, empowered Hinterland\nWomen’s economic SHGs have a positive, statistically significant effect on women’s economic, \nsocial, and political empowerment, with positive effects on empowerment achieved through various \npathways such as familiarity with handling money, financial decision-making, improved social networks\n24, asset ownership25 and livelihood diversification26.\nAccording to an recent assessment27 of DAY-National Rural Livelihood Mission, which is being \nundertaken through the SHGs, (for details see para 6.104) both participants and functionaries perceived \nhigh impacts of the programme in areas related to women empowerment, self-esteem enhancement, \npersonality development, reduced social evils; and additionally, medium impacts in terms of better education, higher participation in village institutions and better access to government schemes.\ncovid-19 response as a montage of SHg’s potential \nGovernment’s Covid-19 Package for SHGs• Under PMGKY , the limit for collateral-free loans for women’s SHGs was doubled from `10 lakh \nto `20 lakh.

They emerged as pivotal players in crisis management, leading from the front in - producing masks (with cultural variants \nsuch as Gamusa Masks in Assam), sanitisers, and protective gear, creating awareness about the \npandemic (e.g. Patrakar Didis of Jharkhand), delivering essential goods (e.g. Floating supermarkets \nin Kerala), running community kitchens (e.g. Prerna Canteens in Uttar Pradesh), supporting farm \nlivelihoods (e.g. Pashu Sakhis for animal health care services, Aajeevika Farm Fresh Online selling and distribution mechanism for vegetables in Jharkhand), convergence with MGNREGS (in UP, \nBihar, Chhattisgarh), and in delivery of financial services (e.g. Bank Sakhis managing bank rush for \navailing Covid-relief DBT cash transfers). The production of masks by SHGs has been a noteworthy contribution, enabling access to and use of masks by communities in remote rural areas and providing \nvital protection against the Covid-19 virus. As on 4 January 2023, more than 16.9 crore masks were \nproduced by SHGs under DAY-NRLM.\nWay forward\nSHGs are well-placed to facilitate overall rural development owing to their access to the last mile, \nability to draw on communities’ trust and solidarity, knowledge of local dynamics, and ability to \nswiftly manufacture simple products and services through the aggregation of members’ economic \nactivities. The demonstration of their resilience and flexibility during crises, including Covid, needs \nto be thus regularised for long-run rural transformation. This includes, among other things, addressing inter-regional disparity in the deepening of the SHG movement, graduating SHG members into \nmicro-entrepreneurs, culturally contextualised skill development for moving up the value chain in \nproducts and services, and including the least privileged under the SHG umbrella . \nQuarterly plfS for urban areas \n6.33 The PLFS conducted by the MoSPI at a quarterly level for urban areas is available till \nJuly-September 2022.

The labour participation rate increased to 47.9 per cent in July-September 2022 from 46.9 per cent a year ago, while the worker-population ratio strengthened from 42.3 per cent to 44.5 per cent in the same period. The unemployment rate declined from 9.8 per cent in July-September 2021 to 7.2 per cent in July-September 2022.This trend highlights that the labour markets have recovered from the Covid impact.165\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\nfigure Vi.5: Quarterly urban employment indicators\n 0510152025\n05101520253035404550\nJul-Sep 2019\nOct-Dec 2019\nJan-Mar 2020\nApr-Jun 2020\nJul-Sep 2020\nOct-Dec, 2020\nJan-Mar 2021\nApr-Jun 2021\nJul-Sep 2021\nOct-Dec 2021\nJan-Mar 2022\nApr-Jun 2022\nJul-Sep 2022\nper centper centLabour Force Participation Rate Worker Population Ratio\nUnemployment Rate (RHS)\nSource: Quarterly PLFS Reports, MoS&PI\n6.34\u2003The composition of the urban workforce for the broad status of employment has been \nstable over the past four quarters, with the share of self-employed at 39.7 per cent, regular wage/salaried at 48.7 per cent, and casual labour at 11.6 per cent in July-September 2022. Similar stability is visible in the work industry, with the share of workers engaged in the secondary sector at 33.4 per cent, and the share of the tertiary sector at 60.9 per cent in July-September 2022. \ndemand Side of employment \nQuarterly employment Survey (QeS) \n6.35\u2003The QES, conducted by the Labour Bureau, covers establishments with ten or more \nworkers in nine major sectors viz. manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, education, health, accommodation & restaurants, IT/BPOs, and financial services. These nine sectors account for around 83 per cent of the total employment in establishments with ten or more workers as per the 6\nth Economic Census (2013-14) conducted by MoSPI. \n6.36\u2003So far, results of four rounds of the QES have been released, covering four quarters of FY22.\n28 The estimated total employment in the nine selected sectors according to the fourth \nround of QES (January to March 2022) stood at 3.2 crore, which is nearly ten lakh higher than the estimated employment from the first round of QES (April-June 2021). The increase in estimates of workers from Q1FY22 to Q4FY22 was driven by rising employment in sectors such as IT/BPO (by 17.6 lakh), health (7.8 lakh), and education (1.7 lakh), due to rising digitisation and resurgence of services sector economy.\n6.37\u2003Regarding terms of employment, regular employees constituted the majority of workers \nacross sectors, with a share of 86.4 per cent in the total workforce in Q4FY22.

For example, out of an estimated 1,98,628 factories in operation, 1,34,577 factories are found to employ less than 50 employees each. However, the distribution of persons engaged is more balanced and right-skewed, with larger factories accounting for a greater share of employment. For instance, 77.3 per cent of the total persons engaged are in factories engaging more than 100 persons. Over time, there is a visible trend towards bigger factories employing more than 100 workers, their numbers rising by 12.7 per cent from FY17 to FY20, compared to a broadly constant number of smaller factories. Between FY17 and FY20, total persons engaged in larger factories rose by 13.7 per cent, compared to 4.6 per cent in smaller factories. Resultantly, the share of larger factories in the total number of factories has increased from 18 per cent in FY17 to 19.8 per cent in FY20, and their share in total persons engaged shows a similar expansion from 75.8 per cent in FY17 to 77.3 per cent in FY20. Thus, in terms of total persons engaged, employment has been rising in larger factories (employing more than 100 workers) than in smaller ones, suggesting scaling up of manufacturing units.  \nfigure Vi.9: trends in employment in factories as per aSi\n 010203040\n0 - 14\n15 - 19\n20 - 29\n30 - 49\n50 - 99\n100 - 199\n200 - 499\n500 - 999\n1000 - 1999\n2000 - 4999\n5000 &\naboveper cent\nEmployment RangeDistribution of Factories and Persons Engaged by Employment Range\nFactories in Operation Total Persons Engaged169\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\n 020406080100120\nFactory size less than\n100Factory size more than\n100numbers in lakhWorkers by Employment Size of \nFactories\n2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20\n 020406080100120140\nFactory size less than 100 Factory size more than\n100numbers in lakhTotal Persons Engaged by Employment \nSize of Factories\n2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20\nSource: ASI, MoSPI\nformal employment \n6.41\u2003Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of the \nGovernment. Following this path, the organised sector job market conditions measured by payroll data for Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) reveal the benefits of the government initiatives towards improvement in the labour market. EPFO data indicates a consistent YoY increase in payroll addition, pointing towards improved formalisation as economic activities picked up. The net addition in EPF subscriptions during FY22 was 58.7 per cent higher than in FY21 and 55.7 per cent higher than that in the pre-pandemic year 2019. In FY23, net average monthly subscribers added under EPFO increased from 8.8 lakh in April-November 2021 to 13.2 lakh in April-November 2022.\n6.42\u2003The swift rebound of formal sector payroll addition can be attributed to the Aatmanirbhar \nBharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY), launched in October 2020 to boost the economy, increase the employment generation in post Covid-19 recovery phase, and to incentivise creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of employment lost during the pandemic. As on 7 January 2023, total registration under the scheme is 75.1 lakh, and total benefits of \n`8,210 crore have been given to 60.2 lakh beneficiaries through 1.5 lakh establishments. \n6.43\u2003Average monthly subscriber additions under ESIC for April-October period improved from 11.9 lakhs in 2021 to 14.4 lakh in 2022.

In FY23, as on 24 January 2023, 6.49 crore households demanded employment under MGNREGS, and 6.48 crore households were offered employment out of which 5.7 crore availed employment.\nfigure Vi.11: number of persons demanding work under mgnregS\n 01234567\nApr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Marpersons in crores2019-20 2020-21\n2021-22 2022-23\nSource: MGNREGS Web portal\n6.46\u2003The number of works done under MGNREGS has steadily increased over the years, \nwith 85 lakh completed works in FY22 and 70.6 lakh completed works so far in FY23 (as on 9 January 2023). Regarding the composition of works, the share of “works done on individual’s land” (included in the permissible work list in 2009 and expanded since then) has increased from 16 per cent of the total completed works in FY15 to 73 per cent in FY22. These works include creating household assets such as animal sheds, farm ponds, dug wells, horticulture plantations, vermicomposting pits etc., in which the beneficiary gets both labour and material costs as per standard rates. Empirically, within a short span of 2-3 years, these assets have been observed to have a significant positive impact on agricultural productivity, production-related expenditure, and income per household, along with a negative association with migration and fall in indebtedness, especially from non-institutional sources.\n32 This has long-term implications \nfor aiding income diversification and infusing resilience into rural livelihoods.\n32\u2002Rapid Assessment of Natural Resource Management Component under MGNREGA and Its Impact on Sustainable Livelihoods, Institute of \nEconomic Growth, May 2018172\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nfigure Vi.12: number of projects under mgnregS\n 020406080100120140160180\n2013-14\n2014-15\n2015-16\n2016-17\n2017-18\n2018-19\n2019-20\n2020-21\n2021-22\n2022-23numbers in lakhCompleted Works Ongoing Works\nfigure Vi.13: Share of completed works under mgnregS (by count)\n 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%\n2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23\nland development share micro irrigation share\nrenovation of traditional water bodies rural connectivity\nrural sanitation water conservation and water harvesting\nwork on individual\'s land flood control & protection\ndrought proofing others\nSource: MGNREGS Web portal, data for FY23 is as on 10 January 2023\n6.47\u2003The Government has been taking several measures to enhance the reach of employment \nopportunities to all eligible and willing to work. One such measure is the National Career Service (NCS) project, which is detailed in Box VI.4.173\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\nbox Vi.4: national career Service project\nThe ‘National Career Service (NCS’)project was launched in July 2015, as a one-stop solution \nproviding an array of employment and career-related services. It works towards bridging the gap \nbetween candidates and employers; candidates seeking training and career guidance and agencies \nproviding training and career counselling. NCS portal has a job fair module to streamline the process of job fair activity on a single online platform by engaging all stakeholders i.e. model career centres, \nnodal officers, job seekers and employers. It is also supported by a dedicated helpline (multi-lingual) \nfor assisting users.\nAs on 5 January 2023, 2.8 crore jobseekers and 6.8 lakh employers have registered in NCS portal, \n2.5 lakh active vacancies and 1.2 crore total vacancies have been mobilised, and more than 9,100 job \nfairs have been organised as part of the Project.\nNCS has partnered with private sector under DigiSaksham programme to offer a free, self-paced \nOnline/Offline Training Programme on “Career Skills”, to equip the jobseekers with an array of soft \nand digital skills with the mandate of improving their employability. This programme also includes \nadvanced computing areas and is being provided free of cost.\nNCS is also working closely with Ministry of Education All India Council for Technical Education and \nAll India Survey of Higher Education ) to ensure that its benefits are reaching to prospective students/\ncandidates. Online integration with EPFO and ESIC has also been done to link the willing employers \nfor enabling them to shortlist right candidates through a countrywide database of workforce on NCS portal. NCS has also integrated with DigiLocker to enable candidates to upload their documents/\ncertificates and make them available to the employers to quicken the hiring process.\nAs per budget announcement of 2022-23, NCS portal has been successfully interlinked with \ne-Shram, Udyam and Skill India portal (primary data source of ASEEM portal). This has resulted in \ndevelopment of an employment ecosystem to facilitate job search and matching for both jobseekers \nand employers . So far, more than 10 lakh candidates from e-Shram have registered on NCS out of \nwhich, more than 1.2 lakh candidates have been shortlisted by employers for jobs. More than 46 lakh \nskilled candidates of Skill India portal have been registered on NCS through data exchange. These \ncandidates can showcase their skills to the prospective employers, thus enhancing their opportunity to get a job. Integration between Udyam and NCS has facilitated more than 4,76,650 MSME employers \nin getting seamless registration on NCS portal.\nNCS has recently added ‘International Job’ module on the portal in March 2022, which facilitates \nemployers registered with the Ministry of External Affairs to post international job opportunities on \nthe NCS portal and the jobseekers to search and apply for these opportunities via the NCS portal. So \nfar, more than 400 plus Recruting Agents have registered on the NCS portal and posted around 1400 \nplus international vacancies.\nthe trend in rural wages \n6.48\u2003Nominal rural wages have increased at a steady positive rate during FY23 (till November \n2022). In agriculture, the YoY rate of growth of nominal wage rates in agriculture was 5.1 per cent for men and 7.5 per cent for women, during the period April-November 2022. In non-174\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nagricultural activities, the growth of nominal wage rates was 4.7 per cent for men and 3.7 per \ncent for women, during the same period. However, growth in real rural wages has been negative due to elevated inflation. Going forward, as inflation is expected to soften with the easing of international commodity prices and domestic food prices, it is expected that this will translate into a rise in real wages.\nfigure Vi.14: trends in rural wages\nNominal Rural Wage: Agriculture  Nominal Rural Wage: Non-Agriculture \n 200225250275300325350375\nMay-20\nJul-20\nSep-20\nNov-20\nJan-21\nMar-21\nMay-21\nJul-21\nSep-21\nNov-21\nJan-22\nMar-22\nMay-22\nJul-22\nSep-22\nNov-22Men Women\n 200225250275300325350375400425\nMay-20\nJul-20\nSep-20\nNov-20\nJan-21\nMar-21\nMay-21\nJul-21\nSep-21\nNov-21\nJan-22\nMar-22\nMay-22\nJul-22\nSep-22\nNov-22Men Women\nReal Rural Wage: Agriculture Real Rural Wage: Non-Agriculture\n 125150175200225250\nMay-20\nJul-20\nSep-20\nNov-20\nJan-21\nMar-21\nMay-21\nJul-21\nSep-21\nNov-21\nJan-22\nMar-22\nMay-22\nJul-22\nSep-22\nNov-22Men Women\n 125150175200225250275\nMay-20\nJul-20\nSep-20\nNov-20\nJan-21\nMar-21\nMay-21\nJul-21\nSep-21\nNov-21\nJan-22\nMar-22\nMay-22\nJul-22\nSep-22\nNov-22Men Women\nSource: Monthly Rural Wage Rates by Labour Bureau33\nensuring Quality education for all\n6.49\u2003The importance of education for all cannot be overemphasised as it is the foundation of \nevery individual and society’s development.

This goal is of critical importance because of the transformative effects that it can have on most other SDGs, such as “no poverty”, “zero hunger”, “gender equality” etc. Sustainable development, in fact, hinges on every child receiving quality education, offering them the tools to develop to their full potential and become productive citizens aiding their own socioeconomic progress and that of their nation. \n6.51\u2003It is in this context that the NEP 2020 was laid down as the first education policy of the \n21\nst century, aiming to address the many growing developmental imperatives of the country. \nRecognising that education is the lifeblood of human capital formation for a young country like India, this policy provided for the revision and revamping of all aspects of the education structure. This includes its regulation and governance, creation of a new system that is aligned with the aspirational goals of 21\nst century-education, including SDG4, while building upon \nIndia’s traditions and value systems. The NEP provides for nurturing all-around development and skill acquisition by youth in an inclusive, accessible, and multilingual set-up. \n6.52\u2003As part of the whole-of-ecosystem approach, the Union Government launched Samagra \nShiksha in 2018 as an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII with an aim to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. \nSchool enrolment\n6.53\u2003The year FY22 saw improvement in Gross Enrolment Ratios (GER)34 in schools and \nimprovement in gender parity. GER in the primary-enrolment in class I to V as a percentage of the population in age 6 to 10 years - for girls as well as boys have improved in FY22. This improvement has reversed the declining trends between FY17 and FY19. GER in Upper-Primary (enrolment in class VI to VIII as a per cent of the population in age 11-13 years), which was stagnant between FY17 and FY19, improved in FY22.

The Guidelines for the same were issued in March 2022 providing for the creation of a conducive environment for enhanced research productivity; encouraging collaboration across industry, Government, community-based organisations, and agencies at the local, national, and international levels and facilitating greater access to research through mobilisation of resources and funding.\n6.73\u2003guidelines for pursuing two academic programmes simultaneously: The UGC, \nin April 2022, issued Guidelines to allow the students to pursue two academic programmes simultaneously keeping in view the objectives envisaged in NEP 2020, viz. providing flexible curricular structures to enable creative combinations of disciplines for study, that would offer multiple entry and exit points, thus, removing currently prevalent rigid boundaries and creat new possibilities for life-long learning through critical and interdisciplinary thinking.  The Guidelines \nprovide that a student can pursue two full-time academic programmes in physical mode or pursue two academic programmes, one in full-time physical mode and another in Open and Distance Learning (ODL)/Online mode; or up to two ODL/Online programmes simultaneously. These will be governed by Regulations notified by the UGC. \n6.74\u2003interest subsidy on education loan: Under the Central Scheme on Interest Subsidy \n(CSIS), launched in 2009, full interest subsidy is provided during the moratorium period (course period plus one year) on education loan taken by students from economically weaker sections (EWS) having parental income less than \n`4.5 lakh per annum for professional study in India. \nThe scheme provides Education loans without any collateral or third-party guarantee.182\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nbox Vi.5: akhil bharatiya Shiksha Samagam\nA three-day Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Samagam was organised at Varanasi on 7-9 July 2022 by the \nMinistry of Education in association with the UGC and Banaras Hindu University.

This not only ensures quality services at the grassroot level but also reduces the chances of ailments requiring secondary or tertiary healthcare services. Between FY14 and FY19, the share of primary and secondary care in the GHE increased from 74.4 per cent to 85.7 per cent. On the other hand, share of primary and secondary care in private health expenditure has declined from 82.0 per cent to 70.2 per cent during the same period.\n6.85\u2003The social security expenditure on health, which includes the social health insurance \nprogramme, government-financed health insurance schemes, and medical reimbursements made to government employees, has increased from 6 per cent in FY14 to 9.6 per cent in FY19. This is a significant increase which shows that the citizens are better equipped and better provided in terms of healthcare at their doorstep making it more accessible.

Public health infrastructure has been referred \nto as ‘the nerve centre of the public health system’, forming the basic support system for the last-mile delivery of public health services. Alongside, human resources for health are identified \nas one of the core building blocks of the health system. These include physicians, nursing \nprofessionals, pharmacists, midwives, dentists, allied health professionals, community health workers, social health workers and other health care providers, as well as health management \nand support personnel. \n6.87\u2003The recent health sector reforms in India have laid emphasis on strengthening health \ninfrastructure as well as human resource in the public sector system. This can be observed in the \nrise in the number of Sub-centres (SCs), Primary Health Centres (PHCs), and Community Health \nCentres (CHCs) in rural areas, along with the rise in doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel over time. With the implementation of the Ayushman Bharat programme, the strengthening of \nSCs and PHCs are being done by converting them into Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs), in \na phased manner, to deliver comprehensive Primary Healthcare services through these Centres.

The programme was expanded to include all persons aged 12 years and above and for the precautionary dose for all persons aged 18 years and above. Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour continue to remain the tested strategy for Covid management.\n6.92\u2003The introduction of Covid-19 vaccines entailed many challenges such as research and \ndevelopment for new Covid vaccines, training of more than 2.6 lakh vaccinators and 4.8 lakh other vaccination team members, optimum utilisation of available vaccine, difficult-to-reach population, and the need to ensure all essential health services along with scaling up of vaccination programme. In addition, logistical challenges such as storage and decentralised distribution of vaccines across 29,000 cold chain points, augmenting cold chain capacity, and developing IT platform for registering the beneficiaries and vaccine service delivery, were also noticed. The programme was able to overcome these challenges and meet its goals within a short time frame.\n6.93\u2003As on 6 January 2023, India has been able to administer more than 220 crore Covid vaccine \ndoses across the country. 97 per cent of eligible beneficiaries have already received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine and around 90 per cent of eligible beneficiaries have received both the doses.

India had alertly \nimplemented surveillance as early as 17 January 2020, even before the first few cases were officially \ndetected. Covid-19 virus posed an unprecendented challenge to the country which was tackled with an agile approach, based on feed-back loops, real-time monitoring of actual outcomes, flexible \nresponses, and safety-net buffers, as discussed in previous Economic Surveys.\n47 Over two years since \nthe pandemic was declared, the Government has taken various fiscal and social measures to balance the revival of the economy and deal with increasing caseloads. These included ramping up health \ninfrastructure, both physical and digital, enhanced training of health professionals and, continuing with the mass vaccination drive. \nUnder the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan, the Union Government focussed on scaling up expenditure \non health infrastructure by (a) investing in grass root health institutions and ramping up HWCs in rural and urban areas; (b) setting up critical care hospital blocks in all districts; and (c) strengthening the \nlaboratory network and surveillance by integrated public health laboratories in all districts and blocks \nand public health units to manage pandemics. The State Governments also took various measures \nto fight the pandemic. This was complemented by digital infrastructure through Co-WIN for mass \nvaccination and e-Sanjeevani for telemedicine to reach the last mile. The timely intervention at all levels helped India navigate the Covid pandemic successfully despite successive shocks.\nIn the last few months, the caseload has subsided significantly, where the active caseload is below \n4000 and daily new cases recorded below 300 ( as of 29 December 2022).

India is one of the countries which has learned the most from the pandemic to create \na mechanism for protecting its citizens and economy. After the successful rollout of two doses of \nindigenous vaccines, the third dose was introduced.\ndedicated covid infrastructure: A three-tier arrangement of dedicated Covid-19 health facilities in the country had been implemented to \nreduce the risk of cross-infection to non-Covid patients and to make provision for non-Covid essential \nhealth services. This three-tier arrangement of health facilities comprises (i) a Dedicated Covid Care Centre with isolation beds for mild or pre-symptomatic cases; (ii) a Dedicated Covid Health Centre \noxygen-supported isolation beds for moderate cases, and (iii) Dedicated Covid Hospital with ICU \nbeds for severe cases. Besides this, tertiary care hospitals under the ESIC, Defence, Railways, Central Armed Police Forces, Steel Ministry, etc., were also leveraged for case management.

As per National Medical Commission (NMC), 13,08,009 allopathic \ndoctors are registered with the State Medical Councils and NMC as on June 2022. Assuming 80 per \ncent availability of registered allopathic doctors and 5.7 lakh AYUSH doctors, the doctor-population \nratio in the country is 1:834 against the WHO norms of 1:1000. \ninitiatives for increasing/hiring/recruitment of doctors & StaffTo further augment the medical education facilities and improve the medical standards, the \nGovernment has envisaged various short and long-term measures, including: -\n(a)  A CSS for establishing new medical colleges by upgrading district/ referral hospitals, under \nwhich 157 new medical colleges have been approved, out of which 94 are already functional. \n(b)  A CSS for strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government \nMedical Colleges to increase the number of MBBS and PG seats.\n(c)  Under the “Upgradations of Government Medical Colleges by the construction of Super \nSpecialty Blocks” of Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) scheme, 75 projects \nhave been approved. \n(d)  Under the Central Sector Scheme for setting up new AIIMS, 22 AIIMS have been approved. \nUndergraduate courses have started in 19 of these.\n(e)  Relaxation in the norms for setting up of Medical College in terms of the requirement for faculty, staff, bed strength, and other infrastructure.\n(f)  Diplomate of National Board qualification has been recognised for appointment as teaching \nfaculty to take care of the faculty shortage. \n(g)  Enhancement of age limit for appointment/ extension/ re-employment against posts of teachers/\ndean/principal/ director in medical colleges up to 70 years.\nTo summarise, ‘Public Health’ being a State Subject, all the administrative and personnel matters, including appointment/recruitment/ engagement of doctors and staff in public health facilities, lie with \nthe respective State/UT Governments. No set of measures is sufficient to counter any instantaneous \nshock like the Covid pandemic, as the measures are designed with the assumption of ‘ceteris paribus’, meaning everything else remains the same. But the major difference is that we are operating in a new \nnormal, and hence towards the end, it is all about better management of the crisis and planning ahead. \nThus, the strong inventory India has built over the last few years will improve the country’s overall \nhealth infrastructure and governance system.198\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nbox Vi.10: co-Win: a successful digital story of vaccination to tell\nThe history of vaccines and vaccinations in India takes us back to 1802 when the first dose of vaccine \nwas registered for smallpox.48 Tracing the medical history of the vaccines during those times was a \nrigorous task. However, in the contemporary scenario, we have substantially progressed in the digital \njourney, and most medical science searches are a ‘click’ away. Also, even before Covid arrived, India \nhad laid down the strategy for mass vaccination as year-long programs were running for several other diseases. Over the years, the government focused on digital health service delivery by imbibing the \nbasic philosophy of “Antyodaya”. However, the need for end-to-end digitisation in the vaccination \nprocess was felt as this was the only way to achieve herd immunity during the pandemic. While many \neconomies had to develop a model from scratch, India was in a comfortable position. Thanks to the \nGovernment’s vision of the JAM trinity, the critical challenge was addressed in a time-bound manner through Co-WIN (Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network) in implementing the National Covid-19 \nVaccination Programme. \nCo-WIN has been developed as an extension of the eVIN (electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network) \nplatform. A comprehensive cloud-based IT solution for planning, implementing, monitoring, and \nevaluating Covid-19 vaccination in India, the Co-WIN system provided an end-to-end solution \nwith utilities for the entire public health system. The dual interface of the open platform made it scalable across citizen and administrator-centric services. To ensure accountability and transparency \nin supply chains for vaccination, the platform provided real-time stock tracking at the national, state, \nand district levels (Government and Private). This further plugged the wastage of Covid-19 vaccines, which otherwise occurred pre-Co-WIN.\nGoing beyond the users (admins, supervisors, and vaccinators), vaccination centres, and beneficiaries’ \nregistration in 12 regional languages, the web solution extended the issuance of digitally verifiable \ncertificates. The Vaccination Certificate was designed at par with WHO Guidelines to assist even international travellers. To reduce the burden of registration hinging on a single document (Aadhaar), \nthe Government allowed registration using any of the 10 photo identity cards [Aadhaar Card, Driving \nLicense, PAN Card, Passport, Pension Passbook, NPR Smart Card, V oter ID, Unique Disability Identification Card,Ration Card with Photo, Student Photo ID card]. Tackling the problem of the \ndigital divide and digital exclusion, multiple beneficiaries (up to six) were allowed onboarding using \na single mobile number through the National Covid helpline. To ensure that those having limited access to physical facilities during times of Covid, either due to age, disability or identity, are not left \nout, special provisions through the “Workplace Covid Vaccination Centre” in the Government and \nprivate sector and also “Near to Home Covid Vaccination Centres “ were made available.\nThe present administration of more than 220 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses was made possible because \nof the robust digital infrastructure of Co-WIN. It was this broad interlock of digital framework and \nthe Government’s vigour of continuously improving its outreach for better inclusion that India could \nregister a quick and durable economic recovery while continuing to secure both lives and livelihoods.  With more than 84.7 crore Co-WIN beneficiaries seeded with Aadhaar among the total 104 crore \n(between January 2021 to September 2022), the seeds of JAM sown in FY15 proved to be a life saver \nfor the nation.\n48\u2002https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4078488/199\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\nSocial protection for the rainy day\n6.94\u2003While growth can lift people out of the low-income trap, it may not be able to ensure that \nthey no longer remain vulnerable to any crisis situations in their lifetime. Thus, it is important to protect citizens from risks posed by rainy days, such as health issues, natural disasters, old age, etc. Especially in the wake of the hardships posed by the pandemic, the government invested more resources in social protection programmes and continued to do so in the FY23 with the understanding that strong social protection systems can support the growth process. Some of the key programmes/schemes in this area are as listed below.\n6.95\u2003pradhan mantri Vaya Vandana yojana (pmVVy): PMVVY is offered by the Life \nInsurance Corporation of India and supported by the Government of India, to provide senior \ncitizens of age 60 years or more an assured minimum pension for a term of 10 years, linked to the price at which they purchase the pension policy. A total number of 8,59,708 subscribers are currently benefitting from the scheme through deposits worth \n`87,081.1 crore collectively under \n11,97,159 policies as on 31 December 2022. \n6.96\u2003pradhan mantri Jeevan Jyoti bima yojana (pmJJy): The Scheme is available to \npeople in the age group of 18 to 50 years and provides risk coverage of `2 lakh in case of \ndeath of the insured, due to any reason, at an annual premium of `436/.

As on 11 January 2023, 32.1 crore persons have been enrolled \ncumulatively and 1,10,298 claims have been paid under PMSBY .6.98\u2003pradhan mantri Shram yogi maan-dhan yojana (pm-Symdy): Launched in March \n2019, the PM-SYMDY is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for providing a monthly \nminimum assured pension of \n`3,000 upon attaining the age of 60 years. The workers in the \nage group of 18 to 40 years having a monthly income of `15,000 or less and not a member of \nEPFO/ ESIC/ NPS (Govt. funded) can join the scheme. As of 2 November 2022, over 49.1 lakh beneficiaries have been enrolled under the Scheme.\n6.99\u2003pm Street Vendor’s atmanirbhar nidhi Scheme (pm SV anidhi): This is a Central \nSector Scheme launched on 1 June 2020, to empower street vendors by extending working \ncapital loans of up to \n`10,000 with a one-year tenure and free onboarding of beneficiaries on \ndigital payment platforms. Beneficiaries are also eligible for the second tranche of loan up to \n`20,000 with 18 months tenure after timely repayment of the first tranche. The scheme is \navailable for beneficiaries belonging to only those states/ UTs which have notified the Rules and Scheme under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. As on 12 January 2023, 45,74,866 loan applications have been sanctioned in all tranches together; out of which 39,43,094 loans have been disbursed.200\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n6.100\u2003Further, to provide loans on easier terms for income generating activities, the pradhan \nmantri mudra yojana (pmmy) was launched in April 2015 to grant loans of up to `10 lakh \nfor income-generating manufacturing, trading, and service sectors, including activities allied to \nagriculture such as poultry, dairy, beekeeping, etc. Under PMMY , both term loan and working capital requirements can be met. Loans are extended through Member Lending Institutions (MLIs) viz; Banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs). The salient features of the Scheme are:\n• Under the aegis of PMMY , MUDRA has created three products namely ‘Shishu’ (loans up to \n`50,000/-), ‘Kishore’ (loans above `50,000/ and up to `5 lakh) and ‘Tarun’ (loans above `5 \nlakh and up to `10 lakh) signify the stage of growth / development and funding needs of the \nbeneficiary micro unit / entrepreneur and also provide a reference point for the next phase \nof graduation / growth;\n• There is no insistence on collateral(s) during sanction of loan;\n• Rate of Interest is decided by the lending institution, interest is charged only on the money held overnight by borrower;\n• A Credit Guarantee Fund for Micro Units (CGFMU) was set up for guaranteeing loans extended to eligible micro units under PMMY by MLIs and overdraft loan amount sanctioned under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts.;\n• From FY21 onwards, loans sanctioned to SHGs between \n`10 lakh to `20 lakh are also \neligible for coverage under CGFMU. The National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd., a wholly-owned company of Government of India is the trustee of the Fund. \npresent status\nMore than 38.4 crore loans, amounting to \n`21.5 lakh crore, have been sanctioned since the \nlaunch of the scheme. Out of this, more than 8.2 crore loans amounting to `6.8 lakh crore have \nbeen extended to new entrepreneurs/ accounts which is approximately 21 per cent of total loans \nextended under the scheme. About 68 per cent of the loans have been sanctioned to women entrepreneurs.\ndevelopment of india’s aspiring rural economy\n6.101\u2003The percentage of the population living in India’s rural areas was as high as around 80 per cent in the 1960s and remained over 70 per cent till 2007. It presently stands at 65 per cent for 2021.\n49 Further, 47 per cent of the population is dependent on agriculture for livelihood. Thus, \nthe focus of the government on rural development is imperative. The emphasis has been on improving the quality of life in rural areas to ensure more equitable and inclusive development. The aim of engagement of the government in the rural economy has been “transforming lives and livelihoods through proactive socio-economic inclusion, integration, and empowerment of rural India.”\n50\n49\u2002Source: World Bank staff estimates based on the United Nations Population Division’s World Urbanisation Prospects: 2018 Revision.\n50\u2002Vision document of the Ministry of Rural Development, Department of Rural Development, November 2019.201\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\n6.102\u2003Various measures have been taken to enhance the quality of life in rural areas \nencompassing rural housing, drinking water, and sanitation, clean fuel, social protection, rural \nconnectivity along with enhancing rural livelihoods.

Geo-\nMGNREGA Phase-II was rolled out on 1 November 2017 and under this phase, the geo-tagging \nof assets is carried out in three stages viz: before initiation of work, during the work, and after completion of work. More than 5.2 crore assets have been geo-tagged (as of 6 January 2023) and \nmade available in the public domain.\nmandatory expenditure on agriculture and allied activities : As per the provision of the Act, the \nDistrict Programme Coordinator is required to ensure that at least 60 per cent of the works to be \ntaken up in a district in terms of cost shall be for the creation of productive assets directly linked to \nagriculture and allied activities through development of land, water, and trees. The expenditure on \nagriculture and allied activities is 68.5 per cent in FY23 (as of 6 January 2023).\ne-payments: e-payments are done under MGNREGA using National Electronic Fund Management \nSystem (Ne-FMS)/ Electronic Fund Management System (e-FMS) for the payment of wages of \nworkers directly to their bank/post office accounts. So far, total expenditure through NeFMS/e-FMS \nis 99.7 per cent.\ndbt: Under the scheme, 99 per cent of wage seekers are receiving their wages directly into their \nbank accounts. It is a big step towards transparency.206\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\naadhaar-based payment: 14.0 crore Aadhaar have been seeded in Management Information System \n(MIS) which is 92.0 per cent of total active workers (15.3 crore). A total of 7.9 crore workers have \nbeen linked to Aadhaar Based Payment System.\nSome of the  good governance initiatives  under the Scheme are:\n(a)  The Job Cards (JC) need to be verified and updated from time to time to weed out the bogus \nJCs, duplicates, and for reasons like migration and death. The states/ UTs have taken up this \nexercise to verify/ update the JCs. \n(b)  As a good governance initiative, the number of Registers (average 22 Registers in a Gram \nPanchayat) being maintained at every Gram Panchayat has been brought down to seven \nRegisters.\n(c)  Cases of violation of Guidelines and Schedules are being followed up regularly. The Interstate \nStandard Operating Procedures (SoP) for visits were developed to improve the quality of the \nsocial audit process for all the states/UTs. This SoP will ensure all the Social Audit compliance \nas per Audit Standard Rule, 2011 which includes the establishment of an independent social audit unit, independent social audit director, and complete human resources to be trained as \nVillage Resource Persons (VRPs), timely calendar upload on MIS, timely conduct of the \nregular audit and uploading the issues on MIS within the stipulated timeline. \n(d)\n  MGNREGA workers are being trained under recent initiatives like Bare Foot Technicians (BFT) to move them up the skilling ladder. So far, 8,394 BFTs have been trained in 20 States. \n(e)\n  The project “UNNATI” intends to upgrade the skill base of the MGNREGS workers, and thereby improve their livelihoods so that they can move from their current partial employment \nto full employment. This project was launched in the FY20 and aims to enhance the skill base \nof 2 lakh MGNREGA beneficiaries in three years i.e., FY20, FY21, and, FY22. So far, about 27,383 candidates have been trained. UNNATI skilling project is meant to provide training \nto one adult member (of age 18-45 years) of a household who has completed 100 days of \nwork under MGNREGA in the financial year from FY19. Full expenditures towards a stipend, \nagainst wage loss compensation, are entirely borne by the Central Government. A total of 2 \nlakh beneficiaries are to be imparted training in 26 States and 2 UT s. \n(f)\n  Around 5.5 crore households fall under the category of landless households dependent on manual casual labour for livelihood as per the SECC 2011. The Government is making all \nefforts to get these households, not having JCs, to obtain employment under MGNREGA. \nAround 4.6 crore such households have been surveyed.\n(g)\n  Area Officer Monitoring App was launched in May 2021, in a bid to facilitate the authorities to record their findings online. It will also help in recording time-stamped and geo-coordinate \ntagged photographs for all the schemes of the Department of Rural Development. It facilitates \nanalysis of findings which in turn help in the implementation of the programme in a better manner.\n(h)\n  National Mobile Monitoring Software (NMMS) App was launched in May 2021 which permits taking real-time attendance of workers at MGNREGA worksites along with a geo-tagged \nphotograph. This app is a big step towards bringing transparency and proper monitoring of the \nschemes and will help in increasing citizen oversight of the programme.207\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\ndeen dayal upadhyaya grameen Kaushalya yojana (ddu-gKy)\n6.109\u2003DDU-GKY is a placement-linked skill development programme for rural poor youth \nunder the NRLM.

Until 30 November 2022, a total of 13,06,851 candidates have been trained under this scheme of which 7,89,685 have got job placements. \nrural Housing\n6.110\u2003Housing is one of the basic necessities, along with food and clothing. “Housing for All by 2022” was rolled out to provide shelter with dignity for each and every one. With this target, the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana –Gramin (PMAY-G) was launched in November 2016 \nwith the aim of providing around 3 crore pucca houses with basic amenities to all eligible houseless households living in kutcha and dilapidated houses in rural areas by 2024. Through convergence with other Government Schemes, the PMAY-G also addresses basic needs such as the construction of the toilet, piped drinking water, electricity connection, LPG gas connection, and 90/95 person-days of unskilled labour from MGNREGS.\n6.111\u2003To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the \nselection is objective and verifiable, PMAY-G selects beneficiaries using housing deprivation parameters in the SECC, 2011 date which is to be verified by the Gram Sabhas. Under the \nscheme, landless beneficiaries are accorded the highest priority in the allotment of houses. A total of 2.7 crore houses have been sanctioned and 2.1 crore houses have been completed by 6 January 2023 under the Scheme. Against the total target of completion of 52.8 lakh houses in FY23, 32.4 lakh houses have been completed.\n \ndrinking Water and Sanitation\n6.112\u2003The UN-SDG6 aims to “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.” India has made considerable progress in providing drinking water and safe sanitation to urban and rural households.

On the 73\nrd \nIndependence Day, 15 August 2019, the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) was announced, to be implemented in partnership with States, to provide tap water connection to every rural household and public institutions in villages like schools, Anganwadi centres, ashram shalas (tribal \nresidential schools), health centres, Gram Panchayat building, etc., by 2024. \n6.114\u2003At the time of the rollout of the JJM in August 2019, about 3.2 crore (17 per cent) \nhouseholds out of the total of 18.9 crore rural households had a tap water supply. Since the launch of the Mission, as of 18 January 2023, of 19.4 crore rural households, 11.0 crore households are getting tap water supply in their homes. Further, four States, i.e., Goa, Gujarat, Telangana & Haryana, and three UTs, i.e., Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Dadra Nagar Haveli & Daman Diu and Puducherry have become ‘Har Ghar Jal’ State/ UT, i.e., 100 per cent households are having tap water supply. Similarly, 121 districts, 1,515 Blocks, 82,071 Gram Panchayats, and more than 1.5 lakh villages have also become ‘Har Ghar Jal Block’ , ‘Har Ghar Jal Panchayat’ , and 208\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n‘Har Ghar Jal Gaon’ respectively. Further, more than 8.8 lakh schools and 9.1 lakh Anganwadi \ncentres are getting potable piped water supply.

FTKs are procured and handed over to Panchayats. The FTK helps to test water on \nnine parameters viz. pH, alkalinity, chloride, nitrate, total hardness, fluoride, iron, residual free chlorine and H2S. Until December 2022, 16.2 Lakh women have been trained in nearly 2.0 lakh \nvillages on Water Quality Testing through FTKs, and more than 58.0 Lakh water samples have \nbeen tested.\n\uf0d8\u2003\u2003There are 2,067 water testing laboratories in the country. Of these, 657 laboratories are NABL accredited. Water testing laboratories have been opened to the public to get their water samples \ntested at nominal rates. Many States have provided mobile vans to enable collecting and testing \nwater samples in faraway remote villages. In FY23, until December 2022, more than 27.0 lakh water samples have been tested in laboratories.\n\uf0d8\u2003\u2003To assess the performance of various local water utilities in states/UTs, a functionality assessment exercise is undertaken every year to assess the status of water service delivery to households. \nAs per functionality assessment of household tap connection – 2022, 87 per cent of the sample \nhouseholds received potable water.\n\uf0d8\u2003\u2003As on 10 October 2022, 8.7 lakh schools (84.6 per cent) and 8.9 lakh (80.6 per cent) Anganwadi centers across the country have been provided with potable tap water supply for drinking & \ncooking mid-day meals, hand-washing and use in toilets.\n\uf0d8\u2003\u2003100-days water quality campaign “Swachh Jal Se Suraksha” was announced on 2 October \n2022 focusing on awareness creation on the importance of water quality through Information, \nEducation, and Communication, training activities and capacity building of villagers using \ncitizen science approach. \n\uf0d8\u2003\u2003Five “Centers for Sustainable Drinking Water”, in various IITs, supported by the JJM are working on developing innovations and technologies for bringing sustainability in drinking water .\nmission amrit Sarovar\n6.115\u2003Mission Amrit Sarovar was launched on National Panchayati Raj Day on 24 April 2022 \nwith the objective to conserve water for the future. The Mission is aimed at developing and rejuvenating 75 water bodies in each district of the country during this Amrit Varsh, 75\nth Years \nof Independence. So far, against the initial target of 50,000 Amrit Sarovar, a total of more than 93,291 Amrit Sarovar sites have been identified and works have commenced on more than 54,047 sites. Out of these commenced works, a total of more than 27,071 Amrit Sarovars have been constructed so far. The impact of this initiative has been:\n• About 32 crore cubic meters of water holding capacity has been enhanced.\n• Water Users’ groups have been associated with each Amrit Sarovar inter-alia improving the \nlivelihoods base of the local community.\n• Participation of freedom fighters, Martyr’s families, Padma Awardees, and other eldest citizens of the local areas helped in community participation at a large scale, promoting social harmony and patriotism, and making this mission a mass movement.210\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n• People’s participation has been seen in this mission in a form of “Shram -Daan.”\n• This will result in the creation of a total carbon sequestration potential of 1,04,818 tonnes \nof carbon per year.\nJaldoot  app\n6.116\u2003JALDOOT app was launched on 27 September 2022 for measuring the water level in a Gram Panchayat through 2-3 selected open wells twice a year (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon). Gram Rojgar Sahayak is required to measure the water level and document the same at the Central server using the Jaldoot mobile app. This will enable groundwater monitoring, water budgeting, and planning for water harvesting and conservation-related works. A total of 3,66,354 wells have been measured as on 7 December 2022. \nSwachh bharat mission (grameen)6.117\u2003Swachh Bharat Mission – Grameen (SBM(G)) was launched on 2 October 2014 to \nensure cleanliness in India and make it Open Defecation Free (ODF).

The release of 9.5 crore LPG connections under the scheme has also helped in increasing the LPG coverage from 62 per cent on 1 May 2016 to 99.8 per cent as on 1 April 2021. \n6.120\u2003Under the Union Budget for FY22, provision for the release of an additional one crore \nLPG connections under the PMUY scheme, i.e., Ujjwala 2.0, has been made. This scheme will offer deposit-free LPG connection, first refill and hot plate free of cost to beneficiaries, and a simplified enrolment procedure. In this phase, a special facility has been given to migrant families. Under this Ujjwala 2.0 scheme, 1.6 crore connections have been released until 24 November 2022. 211\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\nrural connectivity\nPradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)\n6.121\u2003The objective of PMGSY is to provide single all-weather road connectivity to all \neligible unconnected habitations of the designated population size (500+ in plain areas, 250+ in North-Eastern and Himalayan States) in rural areas of the country. The programme also has an upgradation component for those districts, where all the eligible habitations of the designated population size have been provided all-weather road connectivity. However, upgradation is just one of the components of the programme.\n6.122\u2003The programme has been launched in three phases with the latest third phase having \nbeen launched on 10 July 2019 for consolidation of 1,25,000 km through routes and major rural links connecting habitations, inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets, higher secondary schools, and hospitals.

The Scheme involved the organisation of camps in villages/clusters villages for on-spot registration and the release of connections. The connections were given free for economically poor households and for others \n`500 was \ncharged after the release of the connection in 10 instalments. The Saubhagya scheme has been successfully completed and closed on 31 March 2022. \nDeendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) 6.125\u2003This scheme was launched in November 2014 with the objective to improve the quality \nand reliability of power supply in rural areas. It envisaged the creation of basic electricity infrastructure in villages/habitations, strengthening & augmentation of existing infrastructure, and metering of existing feeders/distribution transformers/consumers to improve the quality and reliability of power supply in rural areas. Further, last-mile connectivity and free electricity connections were also provided to BPL households only identified by the States as per their list. \n6.126\u2003A total of 2.9 crore households have been electrified since the launch of the Saubhagya \nperiod in October 2017 under various schemes viz (Saubhgaya, DDUGJY , etc.)212\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\ndirect benefit transfer: a game changer\n6.127\u2003The Economic Survey 2014-15 showed that although price subsidies are widely used \nas part of a standard toolkit by Governments in India in their anti-poverty programmes, they are often regressive, distort the markets in ways that ultimately hurt the economically weak and the leakages thereof seriously undermine the effectiveness of price as well as product subsidies. These distortions and leakages are such that they have an adverse impact on social welfare. It was recommended that the benefit that price subsidies seek to create for the poor can be directly transferred to the poor through lump-sum income transfers, avoiding the distortions that price subsidies induce. Eliminating or phasing down subsidies is neither feasible nor desirable unless accompanied by other forms of support to cushion the poor and vulnerable and enable them to achieve their economic aspirations. The JAM Number Trinity – Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and Mobile numbers – has allowed the Government to offer this support to identified households in a targeted and less distortive way in the form of DBT.\n6.128\u2003Since the inception of DBT, cumulative transfers of over \n`26.5 lakh crore in respect of \nCentral schemes have been made through the DBT route. In this process, total savings of over \n`2.2 lakh crore have accrued as on 31 March 2021 for Central schemes alone due to the removal \nof 9.4 crore duplicate, fake/non-existent beneficiaries across databases. 6.129\u2003With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and the imposition of lockdown and \nenforcement of social distancing norms, the DBT ecosystem faced a tough trial and emerged as a means of relief to millions of citizens whose livelihoods were impacted. DBT played a major role in sustaining life, especially for the underprivileged segments of society, helping millions by providing immediate relief. Cash transfers under central schemes like PM-KISAN, MGNREGS, National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), NRLM, National Health Mission (NHM), scholarship schemes of various ministries through the National Scholarship Portal (NSP) and food subsidy under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana and Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package were a big relief for all the adversely affected masses of India during the Covid-19 period.\n6.130\u2003To make DBT schemes more accessible and transparent, major DBT schemes are being \nend-to-end digitized (EED) with provision for online and mobile-based access. 170 and 150 Central Government DBT schemes are EED and available on Unified Mobile Application for New Age Governance (UMANG) mobile platform respectively. Similarly, over 1000 States / UTs DBT schemes are EED. For citizens who do not have access to smartphones, services available on UMANG are also available in assisted mode through Common Service Centres (CSCs) across India. The citizen experience in accessing DBT schemes through the UMANG app is markedly rich since UMANG offers a well-catalogued bouquet of services in multiple Indian languages to cater to a wide audience.\n6.131\u2003India’s successful implementation of DBT has won praise from the International \nMonetary Fund and World Bank, among other international organizations, for efficiently providing support (subsidies, food grain, and cash benefits directly) to large masses at low-income levels (85 per cent of rural households and 69 per cent of urban households). Box VI.11 informs the progress the JAM-trinity-based DBT framework of social security schemes in India.213\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\nbox Vi.13: progress in direct benefit transfer Scheme\nDBT was launched in 2013 to re-engineer the then-existing delivery processes using modern Information \nand Communication Technology (ICT) to transfer benefits directly into the preferably Aadhaar-seeded \nbank accounts of accurately targeted beneficiaries. In the span of the past decade, DBT has expanded \nfrom a mere 24 schemes (as part of a pilot programme) in 43 districts in 2013 to over 300 Central schemes and greater than 2000 State schemes across India by December 2022.\ntable: overall dbt  progress report\n 2013-14 2016-17 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-222022-23 \n(till 5 Jan \n2023)\nno of dbt \nSchemes28 142 440 426 316 313 310\ntotal funds \ntransferred (in \n`crore)7,368 74,689 3,29,796 3,81,632 5,52,527 6,30,265 3,80,380\nCash schemes 7,368 74,689 2,14,092 2,39,729 2,96,578 2,68,139 1,71,842\nIn-kind schemes - - 1,15,704 1,41,902 2,55,950 3,62,126 2,08,538\neligible beneficiaries [non-unique] (in crore)10.8 35.7 129.2 144.7 179.9 178.9 159.5\nSource: Data as reported by Ministries / Departments to DBT Mission, Cabinet Secretariat\nIn the years of its operation, the DBT paradigm has enabled:\n• Accurate identification & targeting of beneficiaries;\n• Greater inclusion and ease of availing services through online application;\n• Transparency in fund transfers to beneficiaries;\n• Curbing of leakages in the benefit delivery processes through the elimination of middlemen/agents;\n• Creation of greater accountability on behalf of the Government;\n• Facilitating reforms in Government processes through re-engineering;\n• Increase in efficiency in scheme delivery processes; and\n• Effectiveness of schemes through timely implementation.\nenhancing rural governance for inclusive growth\n6.132\u2003Good rural governance is imperative to help translate various programmes and schemes \nof the Government at the grassroots level, ensure equal rights to all, and achieve sustainability of rural development programmes. Some of the recent measures taken towards improving rural governance are narrated below. 214\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nrashtriya gram Swaraj abhiyan \n6.133\u2003A CSS of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) was approved by the Union Cabinet \nin April 2018 for implementation from FY19 to FY22 with the primary aim of strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) for achieving SDG’s with the main thrust on convergence with Mission Antyodaya and emphasis on strengthening PRI’s in the 117 Aspirational Districts. The scheme extends to all states and UTs including non-Part IX of the Constitution of India areas where Panchayats do not exist. \n6.134\u2003The major focus of the scheme of RGSA was Capacity Building and Training (CB&T) to \nempower PRIs and to prepare convergent Plans at the respective level of Panchayats. Under the Scheme, not only around 31 lakh elected representatives (ERs) have been capacitated through various modes of training but also functionaries and other stakeholders of Panchayats including SHG members have been provided training for better SHG-PRIs convergence at the grassroots level to create an ecosystem to prepare inclusive village poverty reduction plan. \n6.135\u2003The scheme has been revamped and approved in April 2022 for implementation over \nthe period FY23 to FY26. The focus of the scheme of Revamped RGSA is on re-imagining PRIs as vibrant centres of local self-governance with a special focus on the Localisation of SDGs (LSDGs) at the grassroots level adopting thematic approach through concerted and collaborative efforts of Central Ministries and State line departments and other stakeholders with ‘Whole of Government and Whole of Society’ approach. The Scheme has been formulated with the aim to strengthen the capacities of institutions for rural local governance to become more responsive towards local development needs, prepare participatory plans leveraging technology, and efficiently utilise available resources for realising sustainable solutions to local problems linked to SDGs adopting the nine thematic approaches of LSDGs.\n59 \nSVamitV a Scheme \n6.136\u2003SV AMITV A (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village \nAreas) is a Central Sector Scheme launched on 24 April 2020, the National Panchayati Raj Day. \nThe scheme aims to provide the ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners possessing houses in inhabited rural areas. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization of properties and enabling bank loans; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive village-level planning, which would be the stepping-stone towards achieving Gram Swaraj in the true sense and making rural India Atmanirbhar. The scheme aims to provide the following benefits:\n• Creation of accurate land records for rural planning and reducing property-related disputes.\n• To bring financial stability to the citizens in rural India by enabling them to use their property \nas a financial asset for raising loans and other financial benefits.\n• Determination of property tax, which would accrue to the Gram Panchayats directly in states where it is devolved or else, add to the state exchequer.\n• Creation of survey infrastructure and GIS maps that can be leveraged by any department for their use.\n59\u2002Following are the themes for LSDGs: Poverty Free and Enhanced Livelihoods in Village; Healthy Village; Child-Friendly Village; Water \nSufficient Village; Clean and Green Village; Village with Self-Sufficient Infrastructure; Socially Secured and Socially Just Village; Village with \nGood Governance and Women Friendly Village.215\nSocial Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent\n• To support the preparation of a better-quality Gram Panchayat Development Plan by making \nuse of GIS maps.\n6.137\u2003As on 31 December 2022, drone surveys have been completed in 2.15 lakh villages across the country, and saturated in the States of Haryana, Uttarakhand, Goa, and UT of Lakshadweep, A&N Islands, Delhi, Puducherry, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Daman & Diu. Over one crore property Cards have been prepared for nearly 65,000 villages. Property Cards of all the inhabited villages of Haryana followed by Uttarakhand, and Puducherry has been prepared.\nconclusion and Way forward\n6.138\u2003History suggests that when different aspects of human development like education, skill, employment, health, and rural development are dovetailed with technology, all-round revolutionary innovation resulting in technology-led growth and prosperity follows. The Hon’ble Prime Minister observed in 2015: \n“The government must nurture an eco-system:– where the economy is primed for growth; and growth promotes all-round development;– where development is employment-generating; and employment is enabled by skills;– where skills are synced with production; and production is benchmarked to quality;– where quality meets global standards; and meeting global standards drives prosperityMost importanty, this prosperity is for the welfare of all ”\n 60\n6.139\u2003Today, India is moving towards the attainment of the UN SDGs. While doing so, it \nis cognisant of the fact that for equitable development, a country as vast and diverse as India requires the implementation of broad-based inclusive social policies, supported by adequate and commensurate financial resources. Thus, the character and contour of such an approach to development presents a unique set of challenges which is consistently being addressed in the form of mindful reforms. Ensuring that intended outcomes of social sector development schemes reach the intended, involvement of the grassroot level of governance is imperative and is being actively pursued. Technology has been a great enabler in ensuring the last-mile connectivity of government schemes to the targeted citizens. It has revolutionised the delivery of services while ensuring transparency and accountability. It needs to be harnessed further to help the government attain the lofty SDGs on the social front. \n6.140\u2003As India marches ahead, the ground lost as regards social sector improvements due \nto the pandemic, has largely been recouped, powered by prompt policymaking and efficient implementation interwoven with technology. Going forward with the vision of ‘Minimum Government; Maximum Governance’, further developments will hold the key to attaining more equitable economic growth. Evident ones include stepping up learning outcomes through digital and teaching interventions in schools, enhancing the role of community workers in healthcare, pushing SHGs through better product design and upscaling enterprises. Further, channelising women’s economic potential through ecosystem services such as affordable market alternatives for care work, safe transportation and lodging, and long-term counselling support, can help capitalise the gender dividend for the country’s future economic and social development. \n******\n60\u2002PM’s Inaugural address at Economic Times Global Business Summit, January 2015 https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?re -\nlid=114728CHAPTER07\nClimate change is primarily attributed to disproportionately high cumulative emissions, \nboth historical and high per capita annual emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) of the developed countries. The global nature of the problem makes India one of the most vulnerable regions despite having contributed only about 4 per cent in the cumulative global emissions (for the period 1850-2019) and maintaining its per capita emission at far less than the world average. While India is less responsible for the high stock of emissions, however, it has consistently engaged in demonstrating global leadership towards adopting various measures and ensuring a low-emission growth pathway with a commitment to the net-zero emissions goal by 2070. \nIndia has integrated the development goals with ambitious climate action goals, be it in \nthe form of augmented solar power capacity (installed), higher energy saving targeting notified in P AT cycle-VII, improved green cover facilitated by Green India Mission, among other targeted Government actions. As part of dedicated efforts to preserve ecosystems, India now has 75 Ramsar sites for wetlands, in addition to various regulatory and promotional measures to protect and conserve mangroves. Continued river conservation and rejuvenation efforts are underway through Namami Gange and National River Conservation Plan (NRCP).\nIn August 2022, the country updated the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) \nin line with the Hon’ble PM’ s vision expressed in the 26th meeting of the Conference of Parties of UNFCCC. In terms of transition to renewable energy sources, India has already achieved its target of 40 per cent installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuels ahead of 2030. It has advanced the target to 50 per cent, which shall also translate to a significant reduction in the average emission rate. The National Hydrogen Mission and Green Hydrogen Policy have been introduced to enable India to be energy independent by 2047. Its pivotal role is also reflected in India’ s Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS). \nThe availability of adequate and affordable finance remains a constraint in India’ s climate \nactions. The country has so far largely met its requirements from domestic sources only. Finance is a critical input for its climate actions. Therefore, the country has scaled up its efforts towards mobilising private capital, including through sovereign green bonds, to meet climate action goals. A framework for the latter has been issued in compliance with International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (2021).\nIndia’ s initiatives on the international stage have been noteworthy. The country has \nactively engaged in global actions by championing the formation and strengthening of \nvarious intergovernmental organisations. Climate Change and \nenvironment: PreP aring \nto FaCe the Future217\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\nintroduction\n7.1 Climate change is the long-term change in temperature and weather patterns that can \noccur due to natural reasons, but since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the 19th \ncentury, it has been predominantly due to anthropogenic activities. GHG emissions remain in \nthe atmosphere for tens to hundreds of years, trapping the sun’s heat from escaping. While within limits, these make our earth more habitable, allowing for salubrious weather conditions, the enhanced emissions have led to rising temperatures with the potential to bring about sea level rise, change monsoon cycles and impact land systems. \n7.2 GHG emissions are the most significant threat to humanity and the inescapable reality the \nworld faces. Action to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to the changing climatic conditions are \nrequired urgently as the world has already started to experience its consequences. For instance, it is estimated that by 2030, about 700 million people worldwide will be at risk of displacement by drought alone (U.N. SDG Portal). Thus, global warming is a reality, and so is climate change. Nor is there much doubt that human activity is primarily responsible for it this time, although climate change occurred in the distant past even when Planet Earth was scarcely populated. \n7.3 Despite agreement on the above, there can still be much divergence about what comes next \nand what to do about it when it comes to climate change. Much of the global angst associated \nwith climate change is about the emission of GHGs and carbon, in particular. The more GHGs are emitted, the more they stay trapped in the atmosphere, accelerating global warming. Hence, the argument goes that if some of the cataclysmic consequences are to be avoided, then global warming must be arrested, slowed and, if possible, reversed. One way to strive for it is to reduce emissions of GHG, including carbon. Many nations pledge to reduce their net emission to zero by 2050. Some wish to achieve it by 2060 and by 2070.\nFigure vii.1: net Zero Pledges of countries (the Year pledged is on top of the bars)\n 2060 \n203020352040204520502055206020652070Pledged Net -zero Year  \n2050 2070  \n2053 \n2045 \nSource: Emissions Gap Report 2022, UNEP218\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n7.4 However, this is where things begin to get interesting. Science is not very clear on \nwhether further emission reduction would necessarily guarantee a stoppage or reversal of global \nwarming.  The reason being much carbon dioxide and other GHGs have already been emitted over the last two and half centuries of industrialisation-led economic growth in today’s advanced nations, principally in North America and Europe. The share of developing countries in the stock of GHGs (usually measured as carbon dioxide equivalent) has been minimal compared to developed countries. This is corroborated by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which highlights that the challenges faced due to global warming are mainly due to cumulative historical and current GHG emissions of developed countries. The impact of the accumulation would also be iniquitous, with the developing countries not only bearing the brunt of climate change but also constrained by their capacity to respond to its challenges. The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) notes that high human vulnerability global hotspots are found particularly in West, Central & East Africa, South Asia, Central, and South America, Small Island Developing States, and the Arctic. \n7.5 Further, as per the report, Asia is most vulnerable to climate change, especially to extreme \nheat, flooding, sea level rise, and erratic rainfall. Ironically, the burden of adaptation is highest \nfor those who have contributed the least to global warming. That unfortunate inevitability means that the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere may have already set a train of events that future emission reduction could do very little to stop or reverse. \n7.6 Even if the answer to this question is unclear or unknown, some correctly argue that not \ndoing whatever we can to make the planet more liveable and less dangerous may amount to \ncriminal negligence. The problem is that the people and nations making this argument have their priorities correct for themselves but not for the countries yet to climb the ladder of prosperity. It is an enduring principle of economics that resources have competing uses and that there are always trade-offs. \n7.7 Today’s developing nations are therefore caught in the horns of a dilemma. How much \nresources to devote to bread-and-butter developmental priorities and to adapting to the already \nchanging climate, and how much to dedicate to mitigating emissions of GHGs? Today’s developed nations have prospered through the unrestricted use of fossil fuels, including coal, crude oil, and natural gas. It is theoretically elegant to argue that switching to renewable or non-fossil fuel energy would generate investments and jobs. Still, it seldom works out so smoothly in practice. \n7.8 For example, China has declared that future energy supplies, including alternative ones, \nmust be secured first before dispensing with existing energy sources. Countries might find \nthemselves not scrapping coal-fired power plants, and the alternatives may be held up either due to a lack of technology, financial resources, skilled and trained human resources, or some combination of all three. Countries have also learnt that the jobs that are likely to be created in the so-called ‘green economy’ are tilted towards skill and technology-intensive than in traditional industries.\n1 One may also argue that it may be easier to speak of retraining and relocating people \nthan actually doing so.\n1\u2002World Economic Outlook, October 2021, Ch.1 World Economic Outlook, October 2021: Recovery During A Pandemic (imf.org)219\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\n7.9 Nobel Laureate Thomas Schelling (2005) argued that the most effective way to combat \nclimate change was to let nations grow first2:\n“If per capita income growth in the next 40 years compares with the 40 years just past, \nvulnerability to climate change should diminish, and the resources available for adaptation should be greater. I say this not to minimise concern about climate change but to anticipate whether developing countries should make sacrifices in their development to minimise the emission of gases that may change the climate to their disadvantage. Their best defence against climate change may be their own continued development.”\n7.10 That economic growth would enable resource generation will come as no surprise to \nstudents of corporate finance. Companies generate profits and internal resources and thus fund \ntheir investments. For companies worldwide, the single biggest source of finance for their capital investments is their own resources before they turn to markets. That would work for nations too. \n7.11 Another reason why it is a realistic proposition is that securing funding from either \ndeveloped nations or multilateral organisations is rather difficult. Public finances in developed \ncountries are stretched and do not seem to have the intent to mobilise adequate resources for climate action in developing countries. They also do not have the appetite to provide additional capital to multilateral institutions for them to be able to lend more or mobilise greater resources. Further, the willingness and incentives-alignment of the private sector to undertake long-gestation projects are questionable at best or non-existent at worst. \n7.12 Lastly, it does not seem so strange or irresponsible that developing countries must put \ntheir own growth and development aspirations ahead of their global climate obligations when \none considers that developed countries set aside their obsessive concerns about climate change and global warming to burn more coal to generate electricity this year. Aiming to reduce their dependence on Russian crude oil and natural gas, countries in Europe had to switch to coal to keep their homes warm and well-lit\n3. The behaviour of European nations in 2022, eminently \nunderstandable, demonstrates the return of energy security as a prime requirement for countries. Therefore, it stands to reason that it would be no different for developing economies too.\n7.13 Earlier in the year, the OECD and the Social Economics Lab at Harvard teamed up \nto understand why policies to address climate change have been difficult to implement and \nsurveyed over 40,000 respondents across 20 of the world’s most carbon-emitting countries (representing 72 per cent of global CO\n2 emissions). The findings were striking4. In general, \ncitizens in developed countries expressed considerable reluctance to change their lifestyles and habits with respect to driving, flying and eating that would contribute to reduced emissions. Policies to implement carbon pricing have not been easy in all European countries. France tried and retreated in 2018. Switzerland’s proposal was defeated in a referendum in 2021. \n2\u2002Thomas C. Schelling (1992): ‘Some economics of global warming’, American Economic Review, March 1992 Some Economics of Global \nWarming on JSTOR 3\u2002‘Germany Revives Coal as Energy Security Trumps Climate Goals’, Bloomberg, 22 December 2022 (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-22/germany-returns-to-coal-as-energy-security-trumps-climate-goals) 4\u2002‘Fighting Climate Change: International Attitudes Toward Climate Policies’, NBER Working Paper No. 30265, September 2022 (https://www.nber.org/papers/w30265) 220\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n7.14 As though these challenges are not enough, many experts also warn of the availability of \nrare earth elements (REE) and critical minerals (CM) to be the next geopolitical battleground \nas crude oil has been over the last fifty years.5 As we are aware, REE and CM are essential for \ngenerating renewable energy. The problem is that they are produced in a few countries and processed in even fewer countries. A globally synchronised energy transition to non-fossil fuels might be difficult to pull off if adequate REE and CM are not available. That would leave the fossil fuel-based assets stranded for many countries’ economies!\n7.15 Jean Pisani-Ferry, associated with the Bruegel Institute and an advisor to the French \nGovernment, has begun to sound the alarm about climate change’s significant short-run \nmacroeconomic costs. Citing him in his article for the International Monetary Fund’s ‘Finance and Development’, Daniel Yergin writes\n6,\n“The economist Jean Pisani-Ferry, cofounder of Bruegel, Europe’ s leading economic think tank, has observed that accelerating the targets for net carbon emission reductions too aggressively could create much larger economic disruptions than generally anticipated—what he called “an adverse supply shock—very much like the shocks of the 1970s.” Such a transition, Pisani-Ferry presciently wrote in 2021, just before the current energy crisis began, is “unlikely to be benign and policymakers should get ready for tough choices.” He subsequently added, in 2022: “Climate action has become a major macroeconomic issue, but the macroeconomics of climate action is far from the level of rigour and precision that is now necessary to provide a sound basis for public discussions and to guide policymakers adequately. For understandable reasons, advocacy has too often taken precedence over analysis. But at this stage of the discussion, complacent scenarios have become counterproductive. The policy conversation now needs methodical, peer-examined assessments of the potential costs and benefits of alternative plans for action. ”\n7.16 However, whether we like it or not, the climate change issue will be increasingly relevant \nand will occupy the airwaves and the attention of policymakers. Countries, even if they wait for financial, technological and human resources for emissions mitigation, have to take action to make their people resilient and adapt to climate change. So, actions on multiple fronts are needed, including the estimation of resources, lifestyle adjustments etc.\n7.17 Here, India, considered to be one of the most vulnerable countries given its long coastline, \nmonsoon-dependent agriculture, and large agrarian economy, is one of the leading examples of \nthis. It has contributed only 4 per cent (until 2019) to the cumulative global emissions and its per capita emission is far less than the world average.\n7.18 The fact that climate change is a global phenomenon and requires collective efforts has \nbeen widely accepted and is the basis of the commitments in the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement. Recognising the differentiated responsibility of countries (in view of their role in GHG emissions) and the higher developmental needs of the developing countries, they call for a collective action based on the \n5\u2002‘The new-style energy crisis’, Daniel Yergin interviewed by Project Syndicate, July 2022 (https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/new-\nstyle-energy-crisis-by-daniel-yergin-2022-07) 6\u2002Daniel Yergin (2022): ‘Bumps in the Energy Transition’, Finance & Development, International Monetary Fund, December 2022 (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/12/bumps-in-the-energy-transition-yergin) 221\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\nprinciples of equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities \n(CBDR-RC). The collective action has translated into NDCs-through which each country has made a commitment to work towards a collective goal of keeping temperature rise to below 2° C above pre-industrial levels.\n7.19 India has been striving to pursue the goal of sustainable development. It spearheads one \nof the most robust climate actions through its NDCs, which includes an ambitious programme \nfor transitions to clean energy in the world. Despite the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on the economy, the country has enhanced its climate ambition manifold and embarked on a long-term strategy towards a low GHG emission based development.  \n7.20 Having set the context, this chapter presents an updated discussion on the issue of climate \nchange from India’s perspective, including a discussion on forests and their role in mitigating \ncarbon emissions, an approach to transition to renewable energy and the recently submitted low emissions development strategy. The chapter further presents a discussion on the outcomes of the 27\nth session of the Conference of Parties (COP 27), progress made on enabling financing for \nsustainable development and India’s role in global efforts towards addressing climate change. Besides this, recent changes in environmental regulations and other environmental aspects, such as biodiversity and wildlife, are also discussed.\nProgress on india’s Climate action\n7.21 India’s climate vision is integrally linked to its vision of development that foregrounds \nthe goals of poverty eradication and guaranteeing basic well-being to all its citizens. Action on addressing climate action was initiated even before the Paris Agreement came into being. In 2008, India launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), establishing eight National Missions, covering several initiatives and a slew of measures in the area of solar, water, energy efficiency, forests, sustainable habitat, sustainable agriculture, sustaining Himalayan ecosystem, capacity building and research and development (R&D).\nFigure vii.2: Progress on eight national missions of the naPCC highlighting achievements \nacross various domains\n •Solar power capacity of 61.62 GW  installed by \nOctober 2022  \nNational Solar Mission  \n•PAT Cycle –VII notified in October 2021 for energy \nsaving target of 6.63 Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent \n(MTOE)  \nNational Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency  \n•721 km of metro  rail network  made  operational  by \nAugust  2022. \n•62.79 lakh individual  household  toilets and 6.21 lakh \ncommunity  and public  toilets constructed  by April  \n2022 \nNational Mission on \nSustainable Habitat  \n•₹ 626.96 crore for afforestation targets over an area of 2.1 lakh ha   \n National Mission for a Green \nIndia  \n•Jal Shakti  Abhiyan:  Catch  The Rain  2022 \n National Water Mission  \n•Created and strengthened 12 Centres of Excellence for climate change (June 2021)  \n National Mission on Strategic \nKnowledge for Climate Change  \n•Inter -University Consortium  \n•8 Major R&D Programmes initiated  \nNational Mission for Sustaining \nHimalayan Ecosystems  \n•Key targets  for FY 2022 -2023 covering  0.15 lakh \nha under  organic  farming  and 10 lakh ha under  micro  \nirrigation  \nNational Mission for \nSustainable Agriculture  222\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n7.22 National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC), a central sector scheme, was \ninitiated in 2015-16 to support adaptation activities in the States and Union Territories (UTs) \nof India that are vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. NAFCC is implemented in project mode, and to date, 30 projects have been sanctioned in 27 States and UTs with a total project cost of ₹847.5 crore. NAFCC supports adaptation action, in, inter alia, agriculture, water, forestry, livestock, and restoring ecosystems. At present (November 2022), 28 projects are under implementation. \n7.23 Demonstrating higher ambition in its climate action, the Government of India submitted \nits updated NDC on August 26, 2022. The new NDC with enhanced targets translates the vision \nof the Hon’ble PM expressed through the “Panchamrit” at the UNFCCC Conference of Parties \n(COP 26) in Glasgow in November 2021. The vision mentions of sustainable lifestyles and climate justice to protect the poor and vulnerable from the adverse impacts of climate change. Aligning with this vision, the share of non-fossil fuel-based capacity in overall capacity has risen rapidly over time.  Including the large hydro, the share of non-fossil sources in total installed electricity capacity is estimated to be about 40.4 per cent (on 31.09.2022) compared to 27.3 per cent in 2014-15. This period has seen a sizeable enhancement in the share of installed electricity capacity in solar and wind energy from 8.9 per cent in 2014-15 to 25.1 per cent in 2022-23 (April-Sept).\nBox vii.1: india’s updated nationally determined Contribution (ndC)\nIndia submitted its first NDC to UNFCCC in October 2015. This was updated in August 2022. The \n2015 NDC comprised eight goals, three of which were quantitative targets to be achieved up to 2030. \nThe three targets included cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources to \nreach 40 per cent, reduction in the emissions intensity of GDP by 33 to 35 per cent compared to 2005 levels, and creation of additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO\n2 equivalent through \nadditional forest and tree cover. \nArticle 4 of the Paris Agreement provides that each Party shall communicate or update its NDC \nevery five years. Therefore, in accordance with the aforesaid provision of the Paris Agreement, India \nsubmitted the following updates to its first NDC of 2015.\n1.  To put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions \nand values of conservation and moderation, including through a mass movement for ‘LIFE’– ‘Lifestyle for Environment’ as a key to combating climate change. \n2.  To adopt a climate-friendly and cleaner path than the one followed hitherto by others at the \ncorresponding level of economic development.\n3.  To reduce the Emissions Intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent by 2030, from the 2005 level. \n4.  To achieve about 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil \nfuel-based energy resources by 2030, with the help of the transfer of technology and low-cost \ninternational finance, including from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). 223\nClimate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\n5.  To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through \nadditional forest and tree cover by 2030. \n6.  To better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in development programmes in \nsectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, the Himalayan \nregion, coastal regions, and health and disaster management. \n7.  To mobilise domestic and new & additional funds from developed countries to implement the above mitigation and adaptation actions in view of the resource required and the resource gap. \n8.  To build capacities and create a domestic framework and international architecture for quick diffusion of cutting-edge climate technology in India and for joint collaborative R&D for such \nfuture technologies.\nSource: Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change\nStatus of Forest and tree Cover\n7.24 One of the three quantifiable targets of India’s NDC is to achieve an additional carbon sink \nof 2.5 billion to 3.0 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The forest \nand tree cover in India has shown a gradual and steady trend of increase in the last one and a half decades.\n7.25 The country ranks third globally with respect to the net gain in average annual forest area \nbetween 2010 and 2020. This gain is mainly attributed to the robust framework and policies of \nthe National and State Governments that have promoted and safeguarded forests. Schemes like the Green India Mission (GIM), Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), National Afforestation Programme (NAP), Green Highway Policy - 2015, Policy for enhancement of Urban Greens, National Agro-forestry Policy, and Sub-Mission on Agro-forestry (SMAF), etc. are among the most important ones. \nCarbon Stock in india’s Forest and tree Cover\n7.26 A robust forest ecosystem is a vital sink of carbon.  Forest Survey of India (FSI) assessed \nthe carbon stock (which is the amount of carbon sequestrated from the atmosphere and stored in biomass, deadwood, soil, and litter in the forest) in India’s forests for the first time in 2004 and then biennially since 2011. The Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR) estimates the carbon stock of forests to be about 7,204 million tonnes in 2019\n7, which is an increase of 79.4 million \ntonnes of carbon stock as compared to the estimates of the previous assessment for 2017. This translates into carbon emissions sequestrated through forest and tree cover to be 30.1 billion tonnes of CO\n2 equivalent. \n7\u2002ISFR-2021. https://fsi.nic.in/forest-report-2021-details 224\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nFigure vii.3: Carbon stock in forests in india has been rising\n 6941 7044 7082 7125  7204 \n69006950700070507100715072007250\n2011\n(ISFR-2013)2013\n(ISFR-2015)2015\n(ISFR-2017)2017\n(ISFR-2019)2019\n(ISFR-2021)Carbon stock (million tonnes)  \nSource: Based on data of the Forest Survey of India\n7.27 Among the Indian States, Arunachal Pradesh has the maximum carbon stock in forests \n(1023.84 million tonnes), followed by Madhya Pradesh (609.25 million tonnes). The per-hectare \nforest carbon stock among different States/UTs indicates that Jammu & Kashmir is contributing the maximum per-hectare carbon stock of 173.41 tonnes, followed by Himachal Pradesh (167.0 tonnes), Sikkim (166.2 tonnes) and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (162.9 tonnes).\nPreservation of ecosystems: a  Critical adaptation action \n7.28 Ecosystems play an important role in carbon storage, protect the coastal areas, and \nenhance water quality besides other services, such as cultural, spiritual or tourist attractions. \nWetlands are natural buffers against floods, droughts, and tropical cyclones. Wetlands can act as sponges, storing peak rainfall and releasing water gradually during the lean season. The floods in Kashmir Valley in September 2014 and Chennai city in December 2015 are reminders of the ways wetland destruction can make lives vulnerable. The Ramsar Convention, signed on February 2, 1971, is one of the oldest inter-governmental accords signed by member countries to preserve the ecological character of their wetlands of international importance. Wetlands declared as Ramsar sites are protected. India has 75 Ramsar sites covering an area of 13.3 lakh ha, and 49 of these have been added in the last 8 years. \n7.29 Mangroves and coastal wetlands form the first line of defence for coastal communities \nagainst increased storm surges, flooding, and hurricanes. As per a recent study, certain mangrove \nspecies in Chilika and Sundarbans along the east coast and Dwarka and Porbandar along the west coast of India are likely to reduce and shift landward by 2070 due to a decline in suitable habitats in response to precipitation and sea level changes.\n8 \n7.30 The Government has taken both regulatory and promotional measures to protect and \nconserve mangroves. The National Coastal Mission Programme on ‘Conservation and Management of Mangroves and Coral Reefs’ is being implemented. Regulatory measures are implemented through Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification (2019) under the Environment \n8\u2002Pujarini Samal, Jyoti Srivastava, S.R.

This \ndedicated support was provided to ensure that the farmers and vulnerable households remained protected from the Covid-19 led shocks.258\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nFigure VIII.10: total Food subsidy released by the government of India since 2014-15.  \n(In ₹ thousand crore)\n 113.2 134.9 130.7 140.0  171.1 164.1 529.7 \n288.7 \n0.0100.0200.0300.0400.0500.0600.0\n2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22(₹ thousand crore)  \nSource: Based on data received from DFPD\nNote: i.

Investment in the sector must be encouraged through an affordable, timely \nand inclusive approach to credit delivery. Intervention by the Government through PM Kisan to provide income support, strengthening of institutional finance and insurance through the PMFBY and the push given to Kisan Credit Cards as also access to machines and tools that improve productivity have been significant. A focus on the horticulture sector and the thrust towards allied activities have diversified farmers’ income making them more resilient to weather shocks. All these initiatives have led to sustainable and inclusive development of the sector.\n8.37 A greater focus on the development of the food processing sector can reduce wastage/\nloss and increase the length of storage, ensuring better prices for the farmers. The initiatives \nlike e-NAM and the Promotion of FPOs formation have been introduced to strengthen the agricultural market. With the interventions including PMKSY , PMFME, PLI, etc., attempts have been made to boost the food processing industries to harness its linkages with the agriculture sector. A well-developed food processing sector with improved infrastructure like cold storage and better logistics helps reduce wastage, improve value addition, ensure better farmers\' returns, promote employment, and increase export earnings. CHAPTER09\nThe industry holds a prominent position in the Indian economy contributing about 30 \npercent of total gross value added in the country. In FY23, the Indian industry faced \nsome extraordinary challenges as the Russian-Ukraine conflict broke out. That led to a \nsharp rise in the prices of many commodities. Prices of edible oil, crude oil, fertilisers and food grains rose sharply. They remained at elevated levels for several months. The \nrisk of another round of supply chain disruptions emerged, but they were not as severe \nas feared. Nonetheless, both the price and the availability of essential commodities had the potential to dent the industry’ s optimism on consolidating the recovery of FY22 and \nfurther accelerating it. It is fair to say that the Indian industry acquitted itself rather well \nunder trying circumstances. Overall Gross Value Added (GVA) by the Industrial Sector, based on data available for the first half of the FY23, rose 3.7 per cent, which is higher \nthan the average growth of 2.8 per cent achieved in H1 of the last decade. \nRobust domestic conditions since FY22 have provided a demand stimulus to industrial \ngrowth. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23 \nwas the highest among all half years, H1 or H2, since FY15. Further, the strong export \nperformance of FY22 continued somewhat in the first half of FY23. In this half of the year, exports of goods and services as a share of GDP have been the highest since FY16. \nHowever, the performance began to wane in the first half itself as the Year-on-Year (YoY) \ngrowth of exports declined from Q1 to Q2 due to persistently high inflation and rising interest rates in the advanced economies. The increase in investment demand has emerged \nas another powerful stimulus to industrial growth. It has been triggered by the augmented \ncapex of the central government in the current and the previous year as compared to the pre-pandemic years. The leap also has crowded in private investment, already upbeat on \nthe pent-up demand, export stimulus, and strengthening of the corporate balance sheets.\nThe supply response of the industry to the demand stimulus has been robust, as seen in \nhigh-frequency indicators. PMI manufacturing has remained in the expansion zone for \n18 months since July 2021, and its sub-indices indicate an easing of input cost pressures, \nimproving supplier delivery times, robust export orders, and future output. While growth in the consumer durables component of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is on \naccount of the release of ‘pent-up’ demand, the increase in capital goods and infrastructure/\nconstruction goods is indicative of the beginnings of a virtuous investment cycle that is expected to be led by the private sector. The growth of the eight core industries of coal, \nfertilisers, cement, electricity, steel, and refinery products has held steady, reflecting a \nbroad momentum in industrial activity. However, the manufacturing landscape further shows uneven growth across various categories, with industries such as automobiles and INDUSTRY: STeaDY  \nRecoveRY260\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nelectronics registering impressive performances while sectors such as textiles have been \nshowing tepid growth, as export demand for these products has been mellowing with the \nslowing of global output and demand. \nIndustrial activity has been supported by an upswing in bank credit to the sector. Credit \nto industry started recovering from the beginning of the year and has been growing in \ndouble digits since July 2022. Credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase in \npart, assisted by the introduction of the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS). While the growth in total credit has been driven by an increase in credit \ndemanded by MSMEs, large industries have begun to increase the pace of their credit \nofftake too since the beginning of FY23 as they look to reduce their pace of capital raising from volatile debt and equity markets. The robust growth in credit demand combined \nwith rising capacity utilisation and investment in manufacturing underscores businesses’ \noptimism regarding future demand. \nAmidst heightened global uncertainty, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the \nmanufacturing sector moderated in the first half of FY23. However, inflows stayed well \nabove the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving the ease of doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the \nworld.\nThe electronics industry continues to ascend in importance as its applications become \npervasive. Electronics, supported by continuously improving communication services, will \nsignificantly enhance productivity, efficient service delivery, and social transformation. \nThis industry’ s significant growth drivers are mobile phones, consumer electronics, and industrial electronics. In the mobile phone segment, India has become the second-largest \nmobile phone manufacturer globally, with the production of handsets going up from 6 \ncrore units in FY15 to 29 crore units in FY21. \nThe Indian Pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticals \nindustry. India is ranked 3rd worldwide in the production of pharma products by volume \nand 14th by value. The sector is the largest provider of generic medicines globally, occupying a 20 per cent share in global supply by volume, and is also the leading vaccine \nmanufacturer globally with a market share of 60 per cent. The performance of pharma \nexports has been robust, sustaining positive growth despite the global trade disruptions and drop in demand for Covid-19-related treatments. The cumulative FDI in the pharma \nsector crossed the US$ 20 billion mark by September 2022.\nThe pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have demonstrated the risk of supply chain \nshocks to the global economic order. As companies adapt their manufacturing and supply \nchain strategies to build resilience, India has a unique opportunity to become a global \nmanufacturing hub this decade. In this context, the government’ s Make-in-India initiative has facilitated investment, fostered innovation and built world-class infrastructure while \naddressing the gaps in domestic manufacturing capabilities. The Production Linked \nIncentive (PLI) schemes across 14 categories has further complemented it with an estimated Capex of around ₹3 lakh crore over the next five years and the potential to \ngenerate over 60 lakh jobs. In the medium term, the scheme will help reduce net imports \nby building domestic manufacturing capacity that will cater to domestic and global needs.261\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\nIntroduction\n9.1 Industry holds a prominent position in the Indian economy, accounting for 31 per cent of \nGDP, on average, during FY12 and FY21 and employing over 12.1 crore people. The sector’s \nrelevance can be identified through various direct and indirect linkages with other sectors, contributing to economic growth and employment. First, it ensures that domestic production can accommodate domestic demand and reduces the reliance on imports. Thereby assisting in the improvement of trade and current account balances. Second, industrial growth has multiplier effects, which translates into employment growth. Some industries, such as textiles and construction, have high employment elasticities. Third, industrial growth spurs growth in services sectors such as banking, insurance, logistics, etc.\nTable IX.1: Growth and Share of Industrial components (in Per cent)\nGrowth in Per cent Real Gv a \ngrowth in \nFY23 over \nFY22Real Gv a \ngrowth in \nFY23 over \nFY20Share in total \nGv a  FY23H1:FY23H2:FY23 \n(estimated)\nIndustry 3.7 4.5 4.1 11.1 30.0\n\u2003Mining & quarrying 2.2 2.6 2.4 4.4 2.3\n\u2003Manufacturing 0.1 3.0 1.6 11.0 17.3\n\u2003 Electricity, gas, water \nsupply & other utility services10.0 7.9 9.0 13.0 2.3\n\u2003Construction 11.5 7.3 9.1 12.8 8.1\noverall Gv a 9.0 4.7 6.7 9.8 -\nSource: National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)Note: Data for FY23 presents the First Advance Estimates\n9.2 Industrial production is a means to increase industrial income in the country. As measured \nby industrial GV A, growth in industrial income has kept pace with overall GV A growth in the \neconomy since the pre-pandemic year of FY20. Manufacturing GV A, which contributes more than 50 per cent of industrial GV A, has grown at an even higher rate when compared to overall GV A. In FY23, the Industry sector witnessed modest growth of 4.1 per cent compared to the strong growth of 10.3 per cent in FY22. This is likely on account of input cost-push pressures, supply chain disruptions and the China lockdown impacting the availability of essential inputs and slowing the global economy. The fading away of the base effect must have also weighed on growth in FY23. On a positive note, estimates of H2:FY23 shows improvement in overall industrial growth, especially in the manufacturing sector, both yearly and sequentially. Easing input prices and conducive demand conditions will support growth, ceteris paribus.\n9.3 In this chapter, the survey will review the performance of the Indian industry in the current \nfinancial year. It explores the demand stimulants to industrial growth, the supply response of the \nindustry, trends in credit to the industry and foreign investment in India’s industrial sector. The chapter also addresses the developments in key sub-industries and their challenges. Towards the end, it evaluates India’s aspirations and prospects of becoming a key player in global value chains.262\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nDemand Stimulus to Industrial Growth\n9.4 FY23 began with the month-old Russian-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of relenting. \nAs the year draws to a close, the conflict appears to have plateaued, although global commodity \nprices are yet to deescalate to their pre-pandemic levels. Industry, throughout the year, has \nthus faced high input costs imported into the country. Fearing demand impact, the industry has been gradually passing on the higher production costs, which has led to sticky but non-rising \ncore retail inflation. Non-core retail inflation, on the other hand, comprising food and energy \ncomponents, has been declining as local weather extremities have eased and interventions by the government to restrict price rises have proven effective. The consequent decrease in overall \nretail inflation has thus sustained the pent-up consumer demand in the post-pandemic Indian \neconomy, inducing an industrial recovery despite the global headwinds. With world commodity prices now also on a downward trajectory and showing up in declining rates of India’s wholesale \ninflation, core retail inflation is expected to relent, making domestic consumption demand much \nstronger to further induce industrial growth in the country. PFCE as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23 was the highest since FY15.\n9.5 Strong external demand also served the Indian industry well in FY22 when manufactured \nexports soared, responding to a rebound in global growth. Trade had also recovered and grown as \nbottlenecks in global supply chains eased. The export stimulus for the Indian economy persisted \nin the first half of FY23. In this half of the year, exports of goods and services as a share of \nGDP have been the highest since FY16. However, the export impulse has been waning in the first half itself as the YoY growth of exports has declined from Q1 to Q2 due to persistently \nhigh inflation and rising interest rates in the advanced economies. Export growth may slow \nfurther in the second half of the current financial year and remain weak beyond that, too, if the global economy falls into recession. However, the strong domestic consumption growth and \ninvestment revival is expected to keep industrial production humming.\n9.6 Indeed, an increase in investment demand has emerged as another powerful stimulus to \nindustrial growth. It has been triggered by a jump in the Capex of the central government in \nthe current and the previous year as compared to the pre-pandemic years. The leap also has \ncrowded-in private investment, already upbeat on the pent-up consumption demand, export \nstimulus, and strengthening of the corporate balance sheets. Capacity utilisation at 74.3 per \ncent in Q1 of FY23 has already reached the tipping point of 75.3 per cent in Q4 of FY22, at \nwhich investments in building new capacities are undertaken. New Investment announced in the manufacturing sector during April-December of FY23 was five times the corresponding level in \nFY20. The surge in investment is also attributable to the policy actions taken by the Government \nover the past several years. A beginning has been made in H1 of FY23, which recorded the highest share of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in GDP among all half-years since \nFY15.263\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\nFigure IX.1: Private Investment gathers momentum\n 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40PharmaCementTextilesAutoChemicalsCapital goodsMiningConstructionElectricitySteel\n₹ Lakh CroreH1 FY23\nH1 FY22\nSource: Axis Bank Research, Capitaline\nBox IX.1: Unfolding of Private capital Investment cycle\nA view is fast emerging that the private sector is predisposed to increasing investment in the third \ndecade of the new millennium. This has roots in the first decade of the new millennium when a credit \nboom financed rising levels of investment rates. Consequently, by the time the second decade began, \nthe balance sheets of both the corporates and banks became stressed. As a result, corporates switched focus from investment to deleveraging while banks slowed credit disbursement in view of high Non-\nPerforming Assets (NPAs). Consequently, the investment rate declined, and the economy began to \nslow. Midway into the second decade, the problems were identified, and mitigation measures were \ninitiated. For the banks, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was instituted to resolve their \nstressed assets while the equity base of public sector banks was strengthened. For the corporates, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout improved their ease of doing business while the corporate tax \nrate was slashed to increase their profits/ investible reserves for financing investment. During the \npandemic, the implementation of ECLGS lent additional support to the MSMEs. Maturing digital infrastructure and easy and cheap data access have further enriched the investment climate.\nFigure a: Deleveraging by private non-financial sector \n 406080100120\nJun-05\nJun-06\nJun-07\nJun-08\nJun-09\nJun-10\nJun-11\nJun-12Jun-13\nJun-14\nJun-15\nJun-16\nJun-17\nJun-18\nJun-19\nJun-20\nJun-21\nJun-22Per cent of GDPCore debt of private non-financial sector\nSource: Bank for International Settlements (BIS)\nNote: Credit to the non-financial sector captures the borrowing activity of the private non-financial sector .264\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nDeleveraging has strengthened the corporate balance sheets, as evident in the declining core debt of \nthe private non-financial sector. Credit to the private non-financial sector as a percentage of GDP \nin India had come down from a peak of 113.0 per cent in December 2010 to a low of 83.8 per cent \nin December 2018. This shows that de-leveraging was completed by the end of 2018. With the \nelections out of the way in May 2019 and with corporate tax cuts announced in September 2019, \nit would have resulted in an improvement in investment and economic growth cycles, but it was \ndelayed due to the disruption caused by the pandemic for two years. Deleveraging resumed from the \nbeginning of FY22 as core debt of the private non-financial sector decreased to 87.8 per cent of GDP \nin the June 2022 quarter from 100.7 per cent in the March 2021 quarter on the back of improved \ncorporate performance and a recovery in GDP levels. \nDuring H1:FY23, the interest coverage ratio was 5, higher than its five-year (FY20) average of 3. \nThe debt-equity ratio also declined from 0.8 to 0.4. These improvements have further absorbed the \nincrease in working capital requirements triggered by volatility in global commodity prices and \nsupply chain disruptions. On the other hand, profit margins peaked in the second half of FY21 as \nlow inflation kept input costs from rising while restricted mobility reduced overheads. Subsequently, \nprofit margins started to decline as input costs rose on the back of rising global commodity prices. \nWith global commodity prices declining, input costs are set to fall, and profit margins are expected \nto increase. Expected increases in profits and strengthened balance sheets have made the corporate sector financially stronger and optimistic about increasing net sales. The Reserve Bank of India’s \n(RBI) Industrial Outlook Survey conducted during July-September 2022 points towards optimism \nabout production, order books, employment, and profit margins for the period covered until Q1 of \nFY24.\nFigure B: Net Sales expected to rise Figure c: Profit Margins Improving\n-40-20020406080\nH2:FY18\nH1:FY19\nH2:FY19\nH1:FY20H2:FY20H1:FY21H2:FY21H1:FY22\nH2:FY22\nH1:FY23Per cent, YoY\n-80-4004080\n-12-7-238\nH2:FY18\nH1:FY19H2:FY19\nH1:FY20\nH2:FY20H1:FY21H2:FY21\nH1:FY22\nH2:FY22H1:FY23\nPer cent, YoYPer cent, YoYNet ProfIt Margins\nOperating Expenses (RHS)265\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\nFigure D: Liquidity and Gearing Ratios \nmarginally healthierFigure e: capacity Utilisation and Business \nexpectation\n00.10.20.30.40.50.6\n0246810\nH2:FY18\nH1:FY19\nH2:FY19\nH1:FY20\nH2:FY20\nH1:FY21H2:FY21\nH1:FY22\nH2:FY22\nH1:FY23\nRatioRatioInterest Cover Debt-Equity Ratio (RHS)\n 6080100120140160\n4050607080\nQ1:FY19\nQ3:FY19\nQ1:FY20\nQ3:FY20Q1:FY21Q3:FY21Q1:FY22Q3:FY22\nQ1:FY23\nQ3:FY23\nIndexPer centCapacity Utilisation BEI (RHS)\nSource: Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy \n(CMIE)Source: RBI Note: BEI stands for Business Expectation Index\nThe credit boom in the first decade increased the banking sector advances to the non-financial sector \nfrom 36.5 per cent of GDP in 2004 to 57.3 per cent in 2014 (Bank for International Settlements). This \nled to the RBI imposing a more stringent assessment of NPAs. Consequently, NPAs rose from 4.3 per \ncent of gross bank advances in FY15 to 11.2 per cent in FY18. However, with the enforcement of the IBC code and a more disciplined approach to credit disbursements, NPA fell to 7.3 per cent in FY21 \nand to a seven-year low of 5.0 per cent in September 2022. The Capital-to-Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio \n(CRAR) and provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) have also improved and stood at 16.0 per cent and \n71.5 per cent, respectively, in September 2022. With well-capitalised banks ready and willing to lend \nand corporates financially stronger and willing to borrow, the credit-investment cycle is poised for an upturn in the third decade.\nSupply Response of Industry\n9.7 The supply response of the industry to the demand stimulus has been robust, as seen \nin high-frequency indicators. The PMI-Manufacturing, for example, has remained in the \nexpansionary zone for 18 months since July 2021. In December 2022, the sub-indices of the PMI-Manufacturing indicated an easing pace of input cost pressures, improving supplier delivery times, robust export orders, and future output. The moderation in input cost inflation has also led to an easing in the momentum of output prices. However, the pace of expansion in new export orders decreased, reflecting a subdued global demand. \n9.8 The sustained growth of manufacturing output is also seen within the overall IIP producing \nconsumer durables in sync with the “pent-up” consumption demand. Robust growth in the \nproduction of capital goods and infrastructure/construction goods is indicative of the beginnings of an investment cycle in the private sector in the next financial year. 266\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nFigure IX.2: PMI Manufacturing remains in \nexpansionary zoneFigure IX.3: Sub-indices of IIP growing at a \nhealthy pace (apr-Nov) \n203040506070\nMar-20\nJun-20\nSep-20\nDec-20\nMar-21\nJun-21\nSep-21\nDec-21\nMar-22\nJun-22\nSep-22\nDec-22Index\n30507090110130150\nManu\nfacturingCapital\ngoodsInfra/\nconstruction\ngoodsConsumer\nDurablesIndexFY21 FY22 FY23\nSource: IHS Markit Source: MoSPI\n9.9\u2003The eight core industries of coal, fertilisers, cement, steel, electricity, refinery products, \ncrude oil, and natural gas are critical in meeting the demand for inputs across industries. The growth in these industries has held steady, reflecting a broad momentum in industrial activity. Their growth underscores the importance that nations have been attaching to the indigenous presence of core capacities in the aftermath of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict breaking down the global supply chain.\nFigure IX.4: Steady Growth in components of Index of core Industries\n205080110140170200\nCoal Crude Oil Natural gas Refinery\nProductsFertilisers Steel Cement ElectricityIndexFY21 FY22 FY23April-November\nSource: Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)\n9.10\u2003Growth in industrial output would have been higher, but for some constraints it faced in \nthe first half of FY23. Seasonality has contributed to constraining the growth of production in respect of mining and quarrying, and construction, as total rainfall in Q2 of FY23 was about 12 per cent higher than in Q2 of FY22. Further, as higher rainfall cooled temperatures, electricity demand fell, and hence output rose by less than 5 per cent in Q2 of FY23 over Q2 of FY22. 267\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\nFigure IX.5: Gv a  construction (a proxy for construction output)  \nconstrained by Higher Rainfall\n0.01.02.03.04.0\n02004006008001,000\nJun- 19\nSep- 19\nDe c-19\nMar-20\nJun- 20\nSep- 20\nDe c-20\nMar-21\nJun- 21\nSep- 21\nDe c-21\nMar-22\nJun- 22\nSep- 22\n₹  Lakh CroreMillimetresAc tual Rainfall Real GVA Constr uction (RHS)\nSource: MoSPI\n9.11\u2003Manufacturing output appears to have been constrained by a large build-up in inventory. \nFor five consecutive quarters ending in Q2 of FY23, an increase in stocks had accumulated to more than 1.3 per cent of the annual GDP. A typical cycle of change-in-stocks juxtaposed with the growth of manufacturing GV A (a proxy for manufacturing output) suggests that the build-up of stock allows manufacturing to slow its pace with the accumulated stock meeting current demand. When stocks start shrinking, manufacturing output increases to meet current demand and replenish stocks before the onset of the next cycle. Stock build-up appears to have thus played an important role in keeping the growth of manufacturing output restrained in Q2. \nFigure IX.6: Gv a  Manufacturing slowing with build-up in stocks and elevated global uncertainty \n-0.20.00.20.40.6\n02468\nJun-19\nSep-19\nDec-19\nMar-20\nJun-20\nSep-20\nDec-20\nMar-21\nJun-21\nSep-21\nDec-21\nMar-22\nJun-22\nSep-22\n₹ Lakh Crore₹ Lakh CroreReal GVA Manufacturing Change in stocks (RHS)\nUseof stock to \nsupport \ndemandModeration in \nstocking and \nmanufacturing  \namid uncertain \nexternal \ndemand \noutlook  Restocking\nsupported by increased \nmanfuacturing \nSource: MoSPI; Note: Change in stocks refers to change in stocks of GFCF .\n9.12\u2003The manufacturing landscape shows uneven growth across various categories. For \nexample, the motor vehicles manufacturing segment’s performance continues to improve, induced by robust demand and an easing of chip shortage. The manufacturing of ‘computer, electronic and optical products’, an upcoming industry, has also been rising. Multiple players looking to make India a manufacturing hub of semiconductors have made the investment outlook 268\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nin this sector positive. Production of coke and refined petroleum has also increased, fetching \nhigh returns in a global market where crude oil prices were higher than in FY22. Chemicals and chemical products such as caustic soda, soda ash, fertilisers and petroleum products have also performed well, contributing to sustaining the growth momentum in the agriculture sector while increasing exports. At the same time, a few product categories, including textiles, apparel and leather, have been showing tepid growth, as export demand for these products has been mellowing with the slowing of global output and demand. Growth in pharmaceutical output has slowed due to an unfavourable base effect and the waning of the pandemic.\nTable IX.2: Growth in Manufacturing Sectors (Per cent, YoY)\n<0 >0 but <5 >5\n Weightsapr-\n22May-\n22Jun-\n22Jul-\n22aug-\n22Sep-\n22oct-\n22Nov-\n22\nFood Products 5.3 3.8 10.1 5.1 -2.6 0.7 4.0 -3.7 9.9\nBeverages 1 29.2 130.3 45.7 13.1 6.4 12.3 2.7 8.2\nTobacco Products 0.8 22 21.4 52.7 -9.1 -12.8 -0.7 -14.3 -5.0\nTextiles 3.3 -0.4 5.9 -3.1 -9.0 -12.5 -13.9 -18.7 -9.0\nWearing Apparel 1.3 55.2 69.9 42.6 15.1 -18.3 -21.6 -36.6 -11.7\nLeather And Related Products 0.5 5 47.5 1.9 -13.5 -16.0 -17.5 -25.5 -2.0\nWood And Products Of Wood And \nCork0.2 4.1 54.1 14.4 7.9 -7.9 -3.7 -14.8 -0.5\nPaper And Paper Products 0.9 -1.9 9.7 8.3 -0.2 -0.1 6.2 -8.2 -2.3\nPrinting and Reproduction Of Recorded Media0.7 30.1 43 45.1 41.2 27.6 29.1 13.5 22.1\nCoke And Refined Petroleum Products 11.8 10.6 18.1 17.4 7.2 6.6 9.7 -1.0 -9.8\nChemicals And Chemical Products 7.9 4.4 24.3 14.8 7.2 5.7 6.4 -2.5 6.2\nPharmaceuticals, Medicinal Chemical And Botanical Products5 -5.5 -13.4 -4.6 -4.7 -17.6 -15.1 -21.2 10.0\nRubber And Plastics Products 2.4 -1.5 8.7 5.7 -2.2 -4.4 -2.8 -2.1 5.6\nOther Non-Metallic Mineral Products 4.1 6.9 22.1 19.6 0.0 1.4 9.7 -3.7 19.8\nBasic Metals 12.8 6.9 16.5 7.2 6.7 4.0 5.7 4.4 8.1\nFabricated Metal Products, 2.7 -0.4 29.2 14.3 -4.1 -14.4 14.6 -11.8 8.2\nComputer, Electronic And Optical Products1.6 6.3 28.7 43.8 2.8 3.3 -0.2 -11.8 3.0\nElectrical Equipment 3 8.3 59.6 11 -16.1 -28.5 -31.0 -33.0 1.2\nMachinery And Equipment N.E.C. 4.8 5.4 38.8 19.9 4.1 2.9 6.4 -7.2 20.8\nMotor Vehicles, Trailers And Semi-Trailers4.9 6.5 87.3 31.2 17.8 22.7 29.1 12.2 22.2269\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\n Weightsapr-\n22May-\n22Jun-\n22Jul-\n22aug-\n22Sep-\n22oct-\n22Nov-\n22\nOther Transport Equipment 1.8 -1.5 126.6 36.2 -1.2 7.8 14.8 -8.1 24.0\nFurniture 0.1 59.3 73.7 31.8 32.4 44.1 30.3 6.4 15.7\nOther manufacturing 0.9 -3.2 18.5 26.4 6.9 4.2 4.8 -31.1 13.1\nSource: MoSPI\nRobust Growth in Bank credit to Industry\n9.13\u2003Growth in bank credit has kept pace with industrial growth, with a sequential surge \nevident since January 2022. While a large share of bank credit continues to be assigned to large industries, credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase in part assisted by the introduction of the ECLGS, which supports around 1.2 crore businesses of which 95 per cent are MSMEs \n1. The impact of ECLGS on increasing the growth of credit to MSME was felt most \nduring the pandemic impacted years of 2020 and 2021. It continued in 2022 as the scheme was extended to March 2023. Furthermore, growth in credit to MSME was buttressed by rebounding consumption levels, particularly in the services sector. Consequently, the share of MSMEs in gross credit offtake to the industry rose from 17.7 per cent in January 2020 to 23.7 per cent in November 2022. While the growth in total credit has been driven by an increase in credit demanded by MSMEs, large industries have also begun to increase the pace of their credit offtake since the beginning of FY23. With the spread between corporate bond yields and marginal costs of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) narrowing, and the volatility in the corporate bond market remaining high, corporates appear to be shifting their sources of financing from bond markets to bank capital, where rates have remained stable and predictable. Robust growth in credit demand combined with rising capacity utilisation and investment in manufacturing underscores businesses’ optimism regarding future demand.   \nFigure IX.7: Double-digit credit growth in Industry driven by MSMes \n -10010203040\nJan-21\nFeb-21\nMar-21\nApr-21\nMay-21\nJun-21\nJul-21\nAug-21\nSep-21\nOct-21\nNov-21\nDec-21\nJan-22\nFeb-22\nMar-22\nApr-22\nMay-22\nJun-22\nJul-22\nAug-22\nSep-22\nOct-22\nNov-22Per centMSME Large Industry Non Food Credit\nSource: RBI\n1\u2002As per the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd.

While segments such as “Petroleum, coal products and nuclear fuels”, “Rubber, plastic and their products”, and “Engineering” have had a steady credit appetite, the improvement in growth of credit to the cement and construction sectors over the past year reflects the improved outlook of the construction sector.\nResilient FDI inflow in Manufacturing Sector\n9.15\u2003Annual FDI equity inflows in the manufacturing sector have been steadily increasing over the last few years. It jumped from US$ 12.1 billion in FY21 to US$ 21.3 billion in FY22 as the pandemic-driven expansionary policies of advanced economies led to a surge in global 271\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\nliquidity. With the rise in global uncertainty in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, FDI \nequity inflow in manufacturing in the first half of FY23 fell below its corresponding level in the first half of FY22. The monetary tightening at the global level has further restricted the FDI equity inflows. A rebound in FDI inflows is, however, expected as the Indian economy sustains its high growth while monetary tightening the world over eventually eases with the weakening of inflationary pressures.\nFigure IX.8: Sector-wise FDI equity Inflows in 2022-23 during april-September 2022\n22%\n34%\n4%\n18%\n5%\n5%\n7%\n4%\n1%Services\nComputer Software & Hardware\nTelecommunications\nTrading\nAutomobile\nConstruction (Infra) Activities\nChemicals (Other Than Fertiliser)\nDrugs & Pharma.\nOthers\nSource: DPIIT data\n9.16\u2003Notwithstanding an overall drop in FDI in the first half of FY23, inflows have stayed above the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving the ease of doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world. The government has implemented an investor-friendly FDI policy under which FDI up to 100 per cent is permitted through automatic route in most sectors. India continues to open up its sectors to global investors by raising FDI limits, removing regulatory barriers, developing infrastructure, and improving the business environment.   \nBox IX.2: FDI Policy Reforms to bolster Investment\n• India continues to open up its sectors to global investors by raising FDI limits and removing \nregulatory barriers to attracting increased investments, in addition to developing infrastructure \nand improving the business environment. To make India a more attractive investment destination, \nthe Government has implemented several radical and transformative FDI reforms across sectors such as Defence, Pension, e-commerce activities etc. \n• In FY20, 100 per cent FDI under automatic route was permitted for the sale of coal, and coal mining activities, including associated processing infrastructure, subject to provisions of relevant acts. 26 per cent FDI under the government route has been permitted for uploading/ streaming \nof News & Current Affairs through Digital Media. 100 per cent FDI has been permitted in \nIntermediaries or Insurance Intermediaries , including insurance brokers, reinsurance brokers, \ninsurance consultants, corporate agents, third-party administrators, Surveyors and Loss Assessors and such other entities as may be notified by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority from time to time.272\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n• To curb opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the Covid-19 pandemic, \nthe government amended the FDI policy, according to which an entity of a country which shares \na land border with India or where the beneficial owner of investment into India is situated in \nor is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route. Further, in the event of the transfer of ownership of any existing or future FDI in an entity in India, directly or \nindirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the restriction/purview of the said \npolicy amendment, such subsequent change in beneficial ownership will also require government \napproval.\n• To simplify the approval process of foreign Investment and to promote ease of doing business, \nthe erstwhile Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) was abolished in May 2017, and a \nnew regime has been put in place. Under the new regime, the process for granting FDI approvals \nhas been simplified, wherein the work relating to the processing of applications for FDI has been delegated to the concerned Ministries/ Departments, and DPIIT is the nodal department for \nfacilitating the process. \n• A revamped portal, “Foreign Investment Facilitation Portal (FIF Portal)”, has been launched as \nthe online single-point interface of the Government of India for investors to facilitate Foreign \nDirect Investment. The portal facilitates single window clearance of applications which are \nthrough the government approval route. The FIF Portal has been integrated with the National Single Window System (NSWS).\nIndustry Groups and their challenges\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) post smart recovery from pandemic\n9.17\u2003While the contribution of the MSME sector to overall GV A rose from 29.3 per cent in \nFY18 to 30.5 per cent in FY20, the economic impact of the pandemic caused the sector’s share to fall to 26.8 per cent in FY21. MSME contribution to the manufacturing sector’s GV A also marginally fell to 36.0 per cent in FY21.  \nMSMe Performance \nFigure IX.9a: MSMe share in exportsFigure IX.9b: MSMe Share in overall Gv a \nand Manufacturing Gv a\n0102030405060\nFY18FY19FY20FY21FY22FY23*Per cent\n010203040\nFY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21Per centShare in overall GVA Share in Manufacturing GVA\nSource: MoSPI, Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S\nNote: *Data for FY23 is until Aug 2022273\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\n9.18\u2003Through the AatmaNirbhar Bharat Package, the government has taken multiple steps to \ncushion the economic impact of the pandemic on MSMEs. Some of the measures undertaken include the modification of the definition of MSMEs; the provision of ₹20,000 crore subordinate debt for stressed MSMEs, ₹50,000 crore equity infusion through Self Reliant India fund; the waiving of the global tender requirement for procurement of up to ₹200 crore; launching of the Udyam portal for MSME registration, a paperless, zero-cost registration portal that is based on self-declaration and only requires Aadhaar. Registrations on the Udyam portal crossed the one-crore mark in August 2022, surpassing the total registration done in the past 14 years under the old regime in just 2.5 years. As of 7\nth January 2022, the portal has a total registration count of 1.32 \ncrore, of which 1.27 crore have been classified as micro-enterprises. Enterprises registered on the portal employ 9.6 crore people, of which 2.3 crore are women. There are 1.5 lakh exporting units, which have contributed a cumulative ₹9.7 lakh crore worth of exports. \n9.19\u2003The government’s initiative of the Samadhaan Portal, set up under the Micro, Small and \nMedium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act to monitor the outstanding dues to the MSME sector, is helping MSMEs in resolving their cashflow difficulties. As of 7\nth January 2022, the \nportal has received a total of 1.3 lakh applications, of which 16.8 per cent have been disposed while 25.0 per cent are currently under consideration, and 25.1 per cent have been rejected. In order to fast-track this process, the government has instructed Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and all companies with a turnover of ₹200 crore or more to get themselves onboarded on the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform for facilitating the discounting of trade receivables of MSMEs through multiple financiers. CHAMPIONS, the single-window grievance redressal portal for MSMEs launched by the Ministry of MSME in June 2020, has received 56,825 grievances as of 16\nth January 2023, of which 55,878 grievances have been \nresponded to. The portal continues to be improved through initiatives such as the localisation of the portal in 11 regional languages and the introduction of a Chatbot. \n9.20\u2003The government has also initiated the ‘Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance’ \nscheme (RAMP) in FY23. The World Bank-supported scheme aims at strengthening institutions and governance at the Centre and State, improving Centre-State linkages and partnerships and improving access of MSMEs to market and credit, technology upgradation and addressing issues of delayed payments and greening of MSMEs. The RAMP programme will be implemented over a period of five years. The total outlay for the scheme is ₹6,062.4 crore, out of which ₹3750 crore would be a loan from the World Bank, and the Government of India would fund the remaining ₹2312.4 crore.\n9.21\u2003The bouquet of measures introduced by the government aided the resilience of the MSME \nsector. Data from the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Corporation (NCGTC) shows that as of 30\nth November 2022, 1.2 crore MSME units availed the ECLGS scheme and raised collateral-\nfree resources to the tune of ₹3.6 lakh crore. A recent CIBIL report2 showed that 83 per cent of \nthe borrowers who availed of the ECLGS were micro-enterprises, and more than half of these borrowers had an exposure of less than ₹10 lakh. The NPA rate in banks for the category of MSME borrowers who availed of ECLGS was lower than the category that did not avail of the scheme. The recovery of the MSME sector from the pandemic-induced shock is evident in the \n2\u2002https://www.transunioncibil.com/resources/tucibil/doc/insights/reports/eclgs-insights-report.pdf274\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\ntrend in GST paid by MSME units.

Electronics, supported by continuously improving communication services, will significantly enhance productivity, efficient service delivery, and social transformation. The domestic electronics industry, as of FY20, is valued at US$118 billion. India aims to reach US$300 billion worth of electronics manufacturing and US$ 120 billion in exports by FY26\n3, supported by the vision of a US$ 1 \ntrillion digital economy by 2025. Improvement in manufacturing and export over the past five years ensures that India is on the right trajectory to achieve this target. Electronic goods were among the top five commodity groups exhibiting positive export growth in November 2022, with the exports in this segment growing YoY by 55.1 per cent.\n9.23\u2003The major drivers of growth in this industry are mobile phones, consumer electronics, and \nindustrial electronics. In the mobile phone segment, India has become the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer globally, with the production of handsets going up from six crore units in FY15 to 31 crore units in FY22. These numbers are expected to improve as more domestic and global players set up and expand their bases in India. Two major global and domestic players in electronic manufacturing services have already embraced the PLI scheme\n4.

Hence, this will further enhance export competitiveness and increase India’s participation in the global value chain. The industrial electronics sector is also seeing growth due to improved digitisation and robotics applications in Industry 4.0. Additionally, the impetus on Smart Cities and the Internet of Things (IoT) will streamline the demand for smart and automated electronics.\nFigure IX.12: Robust growth in electronics exports\n3.95.27.4\n5.98.913.8\n0481216\nFY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\nApr-NovUS$ Billion\nSource: DGCI&S\n9.24\u2003Some of the initiatives and incentives provided by the government to nurture and \nenhance the electronics manufacturing base include the PLI scheme for Large Scale Electronics \nManufacturing, the PLI scheme for IT hardware, the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of \nElectronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS). Additionally, under the Programme for Development of Semiconductors and Display Manufacturing Ecosystem in India, the Cabinet \napproved the comprehensive development of a sustainable semiconductor and display ecosystem \nin the country with an outlay of ₹76,000 crore, the details of which are in Box 3. These schemes and initiatives are expected to boost India’s manufacturing capacity, reduce import dependence, \nand also contribute to achieving the country’s ambitions of becoming a major player in global \nsupply chains.\nBox IX.3: Incentives to encourage semiconductor manufacturing  \nin the US and India\nThe global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the frailties in the supply \nchains of many goods and services. One product that was under the spotlight was the semiconductor \n(more commonly referred to as ‘chips’), and the effect of its shortage was particularly amplified in \nthe automotive industry globally. While the situation has limped back to normalcy, it has prompted a policy response by countries towards diversifying the semiconductor supply chain.276\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nOne of the most notable policies is the United States’ Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce \nSemiconductors and Science Act, 2022 (CHIPS and Science Act, 2022). The legislation aims to \ncatalyse investments in the domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity of the US. The country \nproduces about 10 per cent of the world’s semiconductors and relies heavily on East Asia to import chips. The CHIPS and Science Act directs US$ 280 billion in spending over the next ten years, with \nthe bulk of it going to Research and Development (R&D).\nFigure a: Incentives under the cHIPS and Science act, 2022\nR&D\n71%Manufacturing\n19%Tax Credits\n9%Leading edge tech \nand wireless \nsupply chains\n1%\nSource: whitehouse.gov.in; McKinsey and Co.\nIn the pursuit of Aatmanirbharta and with the objective of plugging itself into the global value \nchain, India has announced multiple incentives to attract investment for developing a semiconductor \nmanufacturing ecosystem. To this end, a comprehensive programme with an outlay of ₹76,000 \ncrore (approx. US$ 10 billion) was approved by the Government of India in September 2022. The government will provide financial support for 50 per cent of the capital expenditure to be incurred \nby the investing firms. \nTable a: various incentives under Semiconductor Scheme\nScheme for Financial Support R&D Support\nSetting up of Semiconductor Fabs in India50 per cent of firm’s \nCapexUp to 2.5 per cent of the scheme outlay\nSetting up Display Fabs50 per cent of firm’s CapexUp to 2.5 per cent of the scheme outlay\nSetting up of Compound Semiconductors / Silicon \nPhotonics / Sensors Fab and Semiconductor \nATMP /OSAT facilities50 per cent of firm’s CapexUp to 2.5 per cent of the scheme outlay\nSource: MEITY\nNote: ATMP stands for assembly, testing, marking, and packaging.

The scheme’s objectives include the nurturing \nand facilitation of domestic companies of semiconductor design, achieving significant indigenisation \nof semiconductor products and IPs deployed across the country, and strengthening the infrastructure \nfor design. The scheme will provide financial support of 50 per cent of eligible expenditure on \nthe design, subject to a ceiling of ₹15 crore per applicant and a deployment-linked incentive of \n4 per cent to 6 per cent of net sales achieved over five years, subject to a ceiling of ₹30 crore  \nper applicant.\nWhile these are early stages, global and domestic players have evinced interest based on the prospects \nfor the semiconductor industry in India and the fiscal incentives provided. Israel-based International \nSemiconductor Consortium has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to invest ₹ 22,900 \ncrore in Karnataka to set up India’s first chip-making plant. Domestic players such as Vedanta and \nTata have also indicated plans to establish semiconductor fabs in the country.\nCoaI Industry: Key in maintaining energy self-reliance during uncertain times\n9.25\u2003At the beginning of the fiscal year, coal availability became a challenge for India’s largely \nthermal-based power generation plants because of a resurgence in economic activity and the emergence of intense heat waves from early March to mid-May of 2022, increasing the demand for power in the country. In addition, in the wake of rising international coal prices, the power sector curtailed coal import drastically from 69 MT in FY20 to 45 MT in FY21 and further to 27 MT in FY22. As domestic coal production could not keep pace with its rising demand from power-generating plants, its availability got limited. Resultantly, in April 2022, even as coal offtake rose to meet higher demand, coal stock with power plants, as on 31st April 2022, fell to 8 days from 12 days a year ago. \n9.26\u2003The government of India undertook several steps on a priority basis through April and \nMay of 2022 to address the supply constraints of coal. First, all generators were asked to import coal to the extent of 10 per cent of their requirements (as against 4 per cent earlier). Penalties, including curtailment of domestic coal entitlements, were announced if power plants failed to import coal. Second, Section 11 of the Electricity Act 2003 (Act) was invoked to direct imported coal-based plants to run at full capacity with the assurance that their enhanced cost of operation would be compensated. Third, tolling was enabled, which allowed states to transfer their allotted coal to private generators near the mines instead of transporting it too far away from state generators. This move eased the burden on the availability of railway rakes. Fourth, Rural Electrification Corporation (REC)/ Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and commercial banks were advised to facilitate the availability of additional working capital to power generating plants.278\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nFigure IX.13: adequate coal Production Figure IX.14: Improving coal Stock\n304050607080\nAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDecThousand TonnesFY20 FY21\nFY22 FY23\n048121620\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDecNo. of Days2021 2022\nSource: Ministry of Coal \nNote: Production by Coal India Limited (CIL), Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) and Captives/OthersSource: National Power Portal\n9.27\u2003Well-timed measures have placed India in a better position to cater to excess energy \ndemand. The coal production for FY23 is estimated to increase to 911 million tonnes, about 17 per cent higher compared to the previous year. In April-December, 2022, coal production rose by 14 per cent on a YoY basis and was 21 per cent higher than the pre-pandemic of FY20. Further, the coal stock at power plants improved to 12 days as of 30 December 2022 compared to 10 days on 30\n June 2022 and 8 days a year ago.\n9.28\u2003Different measures have been initiated towards achieving self-reliance in coal production, including private participation in coal production, FDI under the automatic route, auctioning of coal blocks for commercial production, expansion of existing mines and opening of new mines, greater use of mass production technology in mining, mechanisation of loading, development of evacuation infrastructure etc. \n9.29\u2003The coal industry is expected to grow at 6-7 per cent annually to reach a production \nlevel of 1 billion tonnes by FY26 and about 1.5 billion tonnes by 2030. The enhanced domestic coal production is expected to meet domestic coal demand, replace substitutable imports, and escalate exports. There has also been a persistent effort to improve system capacity utilisation from about 80 per cent to above 90 per cent.\nRe-invigorated infrastructure sector & construction activity to drive steel industry.\n9.30\u2003Steel Sector plays a pivotal role in crucial sectors such as construction, infrastructure, automobile, engineering and defence. Over the years, the steel sector has witnessed tremendous growth. The country is now a global force in steel production and the 2\nnd largest crude steel \nproducer in the world. The steel sector’s performance in the current fiscal year has been robust, with cumulative production and consumption of finished steel at 88 MT and 86 MT, respectively, during April-December 2022, higher than the corresponding period during the previous four 279\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\nyears. The growth in finished steel production is aided by double-digit growth in consumption \n(11 per cent on a YoY basis), bolstered by a pick-up in the infrastructure sector significantly driven by increased Capex of the government. \n9.31\u2003Further, 67 applications from 30 companies have been selected under the PLI Scheme \nfor speciality steel. This will attract a committed investment of ₹42,500 crore, with an increase in capacity by almost 26 million tons and an employment generation potential of nearly 70,000 people. Further, domestic steel makers’ stable credit profiles, deleveraged balance sheets, and robust cash accrual support continue to support their capex. Iron and steel exports moderated in the first eight months of the current fiscal owing to a slowdown in the global economy, particularly in Europe and China, and export duty levied to enhance domestic availability. Yet, iron and steel exports are higher by 20 per cent over the corresponding pre-pandemic levels of FY20. \nFigure IX.15: Increasing Steel Production and \nconsumption (apr-Dec)Figure IX.16: a slight moderation in Iron and \nSteel exports during FY23\n30405060708090\nStee l Consumption Stee l ProductionMillion TonnesFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\n048121620\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\nApr-NovUS$ Billion\nSource: Joint Plant Committee (JPC), Ministry of Steel Source: DGCI&S\n9.32\u2003In the future, the government’s thrust towards infrastructure projects, pick-up in \nconstruction and real estate activity, and healthy demand from the automobile sector augur well for the demand for steel products. However, export demand may remain subdued with the global slowdown. \nGovernment support to help textile Industry weather current challenges.\n9.33\u2003The Textile industry is one of the country’s most significant sources of employment generation, with an estimated 4.5 crore people directly engaged in this sector, including a large number of women and the rural population. In the current financial year, the textile industry has been facing the challenge of moderating exports compared to FY22. However, the levels in the eight six months still prevail, 9.5 per cent higher than the corresponding pre-pandemic level of FY20. Export of readymade garments registered a growth of 3.2 per cent YoY basis during the same period. FDI inflows into the textile sector are yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels. 280\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nFigure IX.17: export of Textiles moderated, \nwhile there is an uptick in Readymade \nGarment exports (april-Nov)Figure IX.18: FDI equity inflows in Textile yet \nto Recover\n0481216\nTe xtiles  Readymade garmentsUS$ BillionFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\n050100150200250\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\nApr-SepUS$ Million\nSource: Dept. of Commerce Source: DPIIT\n9.34\u2003To develop integrated large-scale and modern industrial infrastructure facilities for the \nentire value chain of the textile industry, the government approved the setting up of seven PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks. The parks will not only reduce logistics costs and improve the competitiveness of Indian Textiles but also boost employment generation, attract domestic investment and FDI, and position India firmly in the global textile market. The parks are expected to create a total of one lakh direct and two lakh indirect employment.\n9.35\u2003Further, to boost the production capacity, the government launched the Textile PLI \nScheme with an approved outlay of ₹10,683 crore over five years starting from 1st January 2022 to promote investments and increase the production of Man-Made Fibre (MMF) Apparel, MMF Fabrics and Products of Technical Textiles. This will enable the textile sector to achieve size and scale, enhancing export competitiveness. In the approved 64 applications so far, the proposed total investment commitment is ₹19,798 crore, with projected turnover and employment generation of ₹1.9 lakh crore and 2.5 lakh, respectively. \nGrowth momentum in pharmaceuticals industry sustains after the pandemic\n9.36\u2003The Indian Pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticals industry. India’s domestic pharmaceutical market is estimated at US$ 41 billion in 2021 and is likely to grow to US$ 65 billion by 2024 and is further expected to reach US$ 130 billion by 2030\n5. India is ranked 3rd worldwide in the production of pharma products by volume and 14th \nby value. The nation is the largest provider of generic medicines globally, occupying a 20 per cent share in global supply by volume, and is the leading vaccine manufacturer globally with a \nmarket share of 60 per cent.  \n5\u2002https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1660739281\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\nFigure IX.19: Strong growth in \npharmaceutical exportsFigure IX.20: High inflow of FDI in the \nPharma Sector\n101214161820\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\nApr-DecUS$ Billion\n0200400600800\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\nApr-SepUS$ Million4X\nSource: DGCI&S Source: DPIIT\n9.37\u2003Indian pharmaceutical exports achieved a healthy growth of 24 per cent in FY21, driven \nby Covid-19-induced demand for critical drugs and other supplies made to over 150 countries. The performance of pharma exports in FY22 has been robust, sustaining growth despite the global trade disruptions and drop in demand for Covid-19-related treatments. Carrying forward this growth momentum, drug and pharmaceutical exports during April-October 2022 was 22 per cent higher than the corresponding pre-pandemic period of FY20. Cumulative FDI in the pharma sector crossed the US$ 20 billion mark in September 2022. Further, FDI inflows have increased four-fold over five years until September 2022, to US$ 699 million, supported by investor-friendly policies and a positive outlook for the industry.\nFigure IX.21: Three PLI Schemes to boost Manufacturing  \ncapacity in the Pharmaceutical Sector Critical KSMs/DIs/APIs\n•\nTenure\n:FY\n21 to FY30\n•\nOutlay\n: \n₹\n6,940 crore\n•\nProgress\n: Until Dec \n2022, 51 applicants \napproved with committed \ninvestment of \n₹\n4,138.4 \ncrore.\n•\nEmployment\n: Estimated  \nemployment generation \nfrom 51 projects is   \n10,598 persons.\n•\nFinancial incentive\n: NA Medical Devices \n•\nTenure\n: FY21 to FY28\n•\nOutlay\n: \n₹\n3,420 crore\n•\nProgress\n: Until Dec \n2022, 21 applicants \napproved with \ncommitted investment of \nRs 1,058.97 crore.\n•\nEmployment\n: Estimated \nemployment generation \nf\nrom 21 projects \nof \naround 6,411 persons.\n•\nFinancial incentive\n: The \nfinancial incentive at the \nrate of 5 per cent on \nincremental sales of \nmedical devices for 5 \nyears.

The concerned scheme, Strengthening the Pharmaceutical Industry (SPI), was launched on 11th March 2022 with a total financial outlay of ₹500 crore for five years from FY22 to FY26 with multiple objectives. First, it aims to strengthen the existing infrastructure facilities by providing financial assistance to pharma clusters to create common facilities. Second, it upgrades the production facilities of MSMEs to meet national and international regulatory standards by providing interest subvention or capital subsidy on their capital loans. Third, it also promotes knowledge and awareness about the pharmaceutical and medical devices industry by undertaking studies, building databases and bringing industry leaders, academia and policymakers together to share their knowledge and experience.\nIndia becomes the world’s 3rd largest automobile market\n9.39\u2003The automobile sector is a key driver of India’s economic growth. In December 2022, India became the 3\nrd largest automobile market, surpassing Japan and Germany in terms of sales.  \nIn 2021, India was the largest manufacturer of two-wheeler and three-wheeler vehicles and the world’s fourth-largest manufacturer of passenger cars. The sector’s importance is gauged by the fact that it contributes 7.1 per cent to the overall GDP and 49 per cent to the manufacturing GDP while generating direct and indirect employment of 3.7 crore at the end of 2021. \nFigure IX.22: Rising automobile Sales Figure IX.23: Moderation in automobile \nexports amid weakening global demand\n050100150200250\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\nApr-DecLakhTwo and three-wheelers\nPasseneger Vehicles\n01020304050\nFY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\nApr-DecLakhTwo and three-wheelers Passeneger Vehicles\nSource: Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM)\n9.40\u2003The automotive industry is expected to play a critical role in the transition towards green \nenergy.

Higher \nborrowing costs and tempering global demand are expected to be near-term hurdles.  Amongst structural issues, the increase in long-term third-party vehicle insurance premiums has increased the total upfront insurance cost by about 10-11 per cent, especially for two-wheelers. Therefore, the two-wheeler segment is the most affected and witnessed the lowest sales in the last ten years. Addressing these challenges will boost the automobile industry.  \nIndia’s Prospects as a Key Player in the Global value chain\n9.42\u2003The risk of supply chain shocks has never been more palpable than today, following compounding crises from the US-China trade war, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine. In this fast-evolving context, as global companies adapt their manufacturing and supply chain strategies to build resilience, India has a unique opportunity to become a global manufacturing hub this decade. The three primary assets to capitalise on this unique opportunity are the potential for significant domestic demand, the Government’s drive to encourage manufacturing, and a distinct demographic edge, including a considerable proportion of the young workforce. The manufacturing sector in India is gradually shifting to more automated and process-driven manufacturing, which is expected to increase efficiency and boost the production of the industry. The ‘Make-in-India’ Initiative was launched in 2014 to make India a hub for manufacturing, design, and innovation. Since then, it has facilitated investment, fostered innovation and built world-class infrastructure. The progress made in infrastructure development is discussed in chapter 12 "Physical and Digital Infrasturcture: lifting potential growth". \nMake in India 2.0 and the PLI schemes\n9.43\u2003To further enhance India’s integration in the global value chain, ‘Make in India 2.0’ is now 285\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\nfocusing on 27 sectors, which include 15 manufacturing sectors and 12 service sectors. Amongst \nthese, 24 sub-sectors have been chosen while keeping in mind the Indian industries’ strengths and competitive edge, the need for import substitution, the potential for export and increased employability. Efforts are on to boost the growth of the sub-sectors in a holistic and coordinated manner.\nFigure IX.27: 24 Sub-Sectors under Make in India 2.0\nFurniture\n Air-Conditioners\nLeather ad \nFootwear\nReady -to-Eat\nFisheries\n Agri Produce\n Auto Components\n Aluminium\nElectronics\n Agrochemicals\n Steel\n Textile\nEV Components & \nIntegrated Circuits\nEthanol\n Ceramics\n Set-Top Boxes\nRobotics\n Televisions\nClose Circuit \nCameras\nToys\nDrones\n Medical Devices\n Sporting Goods\n Gym Equipments\nSource: DPIIT\n9.44\u2003In pursuit of the objectives of the Make-in-India programme and with a vision to achieve \nAatmanirbharta, the government launched the PLI scheme. The scheme is expected to attract a capex of approximately ₹3 lakh crore over the next five years. It has the potential to generate employment for over 60 lakh in India and increase the share of the manufacturing sector in total capital formation, which currently stands at around 17-20 per cent between FY12 and FY20. It is further believed that there will be a significant reduction in the trade deficit with domestic production substituting for imports. Sectors under which the PLI scheme has been announced currently constitute around 40 per cent of the total imports. The scheme, spread across 14 sectors, can enhance India’s annual manufacturing capex by 15 to 20 per cent from FY23. \n9.45\u2003PLI Scheme across these key specific sectors is poised to make Indian manufacturers \nglobally competitive, attract investment in the areas of core competency and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiencies; create economies of scale; and make India an integral part of the global value chain. The scheme will benefit the MSME ecosystem in the country. The anchor units built in every sector will require a new supplier base in the entire value chain. Most of these ancillary units will be built in the MSME sector. \n9.46\u2003As of 31\nst December 2022, 717 applications have been approved under 14 Schemes. \nMore than 100 MSMEs are among the PLI beneficiaries in sectors such as Bulk Drugs, Medical \nDevices, Telecom, White Goods and Food Processing. As per recent reporting from implementing Ministries/ Departments, around ₹47,500 crore (US$ 6 billion) of actual investment has been made; production/ sales of ₹3.85 lakh crore (US$ 47 billion) of eligible products and employment 286\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\ngeneration of around 3 lakh has been reported and 106 per cent achievement of actual investment \nreported versus the corresponding projections of FY227. Key sectors such as Large-Scale \nElectronics Manufacturing, Pharmaceuticals, Telecom & Networking Products, Food Processing and White Goods have contributed considerably to investment, production, sales and employment.\n9.47\u2003Some of the latest developments under the PLI programme include the launch of a design-\nled PLI in June 2022 to promote the entire value chain in telecom manufacturing and to build a strong ecosystem for 5G as part of the PLI Scheme for Telecom & Networking products. Approvals under this Scheme have already been granted to eligible companies. In September 2022, the Cabinet recently approved PLI Scheme (Tranche II) on ‘National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules’, with an outlay of ₹19,500 crore to build an ecosystem for manufacturing of high-efficiency solar PV modules in India, thus reducing import dependence in the area of renewable energy. \nBox IX.4: Shipbuilding Sector: achieving Self-Reliance  \nand promoting Make in India\nThe Shipbuilding industry is a strategically important industry due to its role in energy security, national \ndefence and the development of the heavy engineering industry. It has the potential to increase the \ncontribution of the industry and the services sector to the national GDP. With its immense direct and \nindirect linkages with most other leading industries, such as steel, aluminum, electrical machinery and equipment etc., and its huge dependence on infrastructure and services sectors of the economy, the \nshipbuilding industry has the potential to strengthen the mission of an ‘Aatmanirbhar’ Bharat. The \nIndian Navy (IN) shipbuilding projects currently in progress at various Indian shipyards are poised to \nprovide the requisite impetus to the industry. With the objective to achieve strategic independence in \nshipbuilding and development of niche technology, as of date, more than 130 IN warships have been constructed at Indian shipyards, and presently, 41 of 43 ships and submarines are being constructed \nat various public and private sector Indian shipyards. These initiatives, through various channels, are \ncontributing to economic growth and employment in the country.\nBoost to ancillary Industry\nShipbuilding with its links to other ancillary industries, including steel, engineering equipment, \nport infrastructure, trade and shipping services has the potential to create a collaborative production eco-system. With the development of these ancillary industries, the sector generates opportunities \nfor smaller businesses and strengthens supply chain networks. It is noteworthy that a significant \nproportion of value addition, approximately 65 per cent, in the construction of a ship is derived from manufacturers of shipboard materials, equipment, and systems. \nSignificant Investment and employment Generation Multiplier effects\nBased on International shipbuilding statistics, if one takes a conservative Marginal Consumption to \nGDP Ratio (MCGR) of 0.45 for the shipbuilding sector, the investment multiplier would be approx. \naround 1.82. For example, an injection of approx. ₹1.5 lakh crore in naval shipbuilding projects \nwould accrue a circulation of ₹2.73 lakh crore in the shipbuilding sector due to the multiplier ef fect.\nAmong manufacturing activities, shipbuilding has one of the highest employment multipliers \nof 6.4\n8. It is capable of generating mass employment in remote, coastal and rural areas, thereby \n7\u2002https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1884181\n8\u2002https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1593424287\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\nabsorbing the labour migrating from agricultural pursuits to manufacturing facilities established by \nshipyards and their ancillary industries. The Indigenisation initiatives implemented by the IN have \nresulted in a significant infusion of economic activity by creating employment opportunities for MSMEs \nand other industries. For instance, the recently commissioned INS Vikrant alone engaged approximately 500 MSMEs, 12,000 employees from ancillary industries, and 2,000 shipyard employees.\nFurther, a study undertaken by the IN for the construction of seven P17A ships reveals that around \nthree-fourths of the total project cost of warships is invested back into the Indian economy. This investment is ploughed back into the economy through indigenous sourcing of raw materials, \ndevelopment of equipment and systems installed onboard ships and other manpower services. \nBesides benefiting the ancillary industries and creating massive employment opportunities, an \nindigenous shipping and shipbuilding industry can also reduce freight bills and forex outgo, thereby \nreducing the current account deficit.\nThus, we see that the strong forward and backward linkages of the shipbuilding sector play an \nimportant part in the creation of a self-relient India.\nFostering Innovation  \n9.48\u2003The government’s efforts towards fostering innovation include incubation, handholding, \nfunding, industry-academia partnership and mentorship. The government has also strengthened its IPR regime by modernising the IP office, reducing legal compliances and facilitating IP filing for start-ups, women entrepreneurs, small industries and others. This has resulted in a 46 per cent growth in the domestic filing of patents over 2016-2021, signalling India’s transition towards a knowledge-based economy.\n9.49\u2003These measures have begun to pay dividends. The Global Innovation Index (GII) ranks \nthe countries based on innovation performance, comprising around 80 indicators, including measures on the political environment, education, infrastructure and knowledge creation of each economy. As per the GII 2022 report, India entered the top 40 innovating countries for the first time in 2022 since the inception of the GII in 2007 by improving its rank from 81 in 2015 to 40 in 2022. Further, India became the most innovative nation in the lower middle-income group overtaking Vietnam (48\nth) and leading the Central and Southern Asia region.\nBox XI.5: ‘Flipping and Reverse Flipping: the recent developments in Start-ups’\nIndia ranks amongst the largest startup ecosystems in the world. An impressive 9 lakh+ direct jobs \nhave been created by the DPIIT recognised startups (self-reported), with a notable 64 per cent increase \nin 2022 over the average number of new jobs created in the last three years. About 48 per cent of our \nstartups are from Tier II & III cities, a testimony of our grassroots’ tremendous potential.\nVarious targeted initiatives of the Government have given a major boost to start-ups. For instance, \nunder the Start-up India Initiative, eligible companies get recognised as Start-ups by DPIIT to access \na host of tax benefits, easier compliance, and IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) fast-tracking. As part \nof the umbrella schemes of the National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations \n(NIDHI) and atal Innovation Mission (aIM), entrepreneurship and innovation are fostered across \nthe start-up ecosystem in the country. The Fund of Funds for Start-ups (FFS) and Credit Guarantee288\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nScheme for Start-ups (CGSS) support seed funding and successive credit needs. The R&D \nplatform for technology sectors is offered by schemes such as MeitY Start-up Hub (MSH) and \nTechnology Incubation and Development of entrepreneurs (TIDe 2.0), among others. \nEngaging Indian start-ups with global peers is another essential pillar of Start-up India and is facilitated through Government-to-Government partnerships, participation in international forums, \nand hosting of global events. Further, the Support for International Patent Protection in e&IT \n(SIP-eIT) Scheme encourages international patent filing by Indian MSMEs and start-ups\n9. \nFigure a: Jobs created by Start-ups\n4388132161198269\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022ThousandsTotal Number of Jobs Created (self-reported) by DPIIT \nRecognised Start-ups\nNote: Data as on 17th January 2023\nWhile external support from the government has made it relatively easier than before for entrepreneurship to thrive, there are several inherent challenges faced by start-ups. Be it ever-elusive \nfunding, revenue generation struggles, lack of easy access to supportive infrastructure, or wading \nthrough the regulatory environment and tax structures. It has also been observed that many Indian companies have been getting headquartered overseas, especially in destinations with favourable legal \nenvironments and taxation policies. The technical jargon for this may be identified as ‘Flipping’, \nwhich is the process of transferring the entire ownership of an Indian company to an overseas entity, \naccompanied by a transfer of all IP and all data hitherto owned by the Indian company. It effectively \ntransforms an Indian company into a 100 per cent subsidiary of a foreign entity, with the founders and investors retaining the same ownership via the foreign entity, having swapped all shares.\nTypically, “Flipping” happens at the early stage of the Start-ups, driven by commercial, taxation and \npersonal preferences of founders and investors. Some companies decide to “Flip” because the major market of their product is offshore. Sometimes, investor preferences like access to incubators drive \nthe companies to “Flip” as they insist on a particular domicile. Some companies prefer to domicile in \ncountries where they would like to access Capital Market later for better valuations and ticket size. Better protection and enforcement of IP and tax treatment of Licensing revenue from IP, residential \nstatus of Founders, and agile corporate structures have been the reasons for “Flipping” in the Past.\nIn popular holding company jurisdictions like Singapore, dividends received from a Singaporean \ncompany/subsidiary are not taxed at the holding level. There are no withholding taxes when\n9\u2002Source: PIB https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1884256, https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx -\n?PRID=1884069#:~:text=PLI%20Scheme%20extends%20an%20incentive,2020289\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\ndistributing dividends to residents or non-resident shareholders. This is a critical component since the \ndividend is one of the most popular repatriation tools. There are no withholding taxes in the United \nArab Emirates (Uae) under current legislation. These jurisdictions have tailor-made their policies \nand tax and incentive structures to incentivise companies to store IPs and create Holding companies as Regional Headquarters. European jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands, provide for participation \nexemptions on dividends and capital gains (based on certain shareholding thresholds, i.e., 5 per cent and other tests). These exemptions are currently unavailable in India, and any migration of existing \nstructures to India triggers capital gains tax. However, of late, with relatively easy access to Capital \nthrough a vibrant Private Equity/Venture Capital Ecosystem, changes in rules regarding round-tripping, and the growing maturity of India’s capital markets have not only slowed down the Flipping, \nbut companies are also exploring “Reverse Flipping”.\nFigure B: effect of Flipping on the structure of the company\nPre-Flipping Post-Flipping\n \n \nTo accelerate ‘Reverse Flipping’, certain measures are possible, some of which are listed below:\ni.  Simplifying the process for grant of “Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB) certification” for Start-ups\nii. Further simplification of taxation of Employee Stock Options (ESOPs)\niii.  Simplifying multiple layers of tax and uncertainty due to tax litigation\niv.  Simplifying procedures for capital flows: Many countries, such as US and Singapore, have easier \ncorporate laws, with lesser restrictions on the inflow and outflow of capital and treatment of \nHybrid Securities\nv.  Facilitating improved collaboration and partnerships with established private entities to develop \nbest practices and state-of-the-art start-up mentorship platforms\nvi.  Exploring the incubation and funding landscape for start-ups in emerging fields like social innovation and impact investment.\nThe flipping phenomenon mentioned above reflects start-ups venturing out for short-term gains in the \ndynamic, uncertain geopolitical world. However, the flip can be reversed with the collective action by \nthe Government related regulatory bodies and other stakeholders. With solution-oriented strategies, start-ups will continue to be the messengers of India’s entrepreneurial dynamism.290\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nStructural reforms have enhanced the Ease of Doing Business\n9.50\u2003The ‘Make in India’ initiative has been striving to ensure that the business ecosystem \nin the nation is conducive for investors doing business in India and contributing to the growth and development of the Nation. This has been done through various reforms that have led to increased investment inflows and economic growth. The reform measures include amendments to laws and liberalisation of guidelines and regulations to reduce compliance burdens, bring down costs and enhance the ease of doing business in India. Burdensome compliances with rules and regulations have been reduced through simplification, rationalisation, decriminalisation, and digitisation. Steps to promote manufacturing and investments include reduction in corporate taxes, public procurement and Phased Manufacturing Programme. \n9.51\u2003The DPIIT’s Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2020 (fifth edition), based on \nthe implementation of reforms by States/UTs, was released on 30\nth June 2022. It shows that \n7,496 reforms were implemented across States and UTs as part of the BRAP 2020 assessment, thereby significantly enhancing the Ease of Doing Business across the country. Reducing the Compliance Burden (RCB) on businesses and citizens is a continuous exercise to leapfrog to the next level of governance excellence and improve Ease of Living. Ministries and States/UTs have reduced more than 39,000 compliances (as on 17\nth January 2023). Specifically, more than \n3,500 provisions related to minor technical or procedural defaults have been decriminalised by Ministries and States/UTs based on details uploaded on DPIIT’s Regulatory Compliance Portal as on 17\nth January 2023. Further, the NSWS was soft-launched in September 2021 to improve \nthe ease of doing business by providing a single digital platform to investors for approvals and clearances. The portal is rapidly gaining traction amongst the investor community and, as of 10\nth January 2023, has about 4.3 lakh plus unique visitors. 81,000+ approvals have been \nfacilitated through NSWS, and 43,000+ approvals are currently under process. The portal will progressively onboard more approvals and licenses based on user /industry feedback. This portal has integrated multiple existing clearance systems of the various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments to enhance investor experience.\nIndia and Industry 4.0\n9.52\u2003The advent of the fourth industrial revolution or industry 4.0 as it’s commonly referred to, has begun. The transformation integrates new technologies such as cloud computing, IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) into manufacturing processes, leading to efficiencies across the value chain. While the adoption of these technologies in the Indian manufacturing sector is underway, large-scale adoption is yet to happen. However, an enabling environment is rapidly developing. In recent years, India has made significant strides in internet penetration which is one of the key requisites of industry 4.0. The push towards self-reliance in semiconductor technology and production will help India erect another pillar of this revolution – hyper-efficient processing technology.\n9.53\u2003The government is cognisant of the importance of industry 4.0 in achieving the goals \nof Aatmanirbharta and its ambitions of becoming a key player in global value chains. A few initiatives by the government include the SAMARTH (Smart Advanced Manufacturing and Rapid Transformation Hubs) Udyog Bharat 4.0 under the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, which aims to encourage technological solutions to Indian manufacturing 291\nIndustry: Steady Recovery\nunits through awareness programmes and demonstrations. Another initiative is the establishment \nof the Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution in India in 2018, which looks to develop policy frameworks for emerging technologies. \nconclusion and outlook\n9.54\u2003Despite global headwinds, industrial production expanded during FY23, backed by sustained demand conditions. The growth in bank credit has kept pace with industrial growth, with a sequential surge evident since January 2022. Credit to MSMEs has seen a significant increase in part, assisted by the introduction of the ECLGS. Amidst heightened global uncertainty, FDI in the manufacturing sector moderated in the first half of FY23. However, inflows stayed well above the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving the ease of doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world.\n9.55\u2003On the positive side, easing input cost pressures owing to a fall in international commodity \nprices augurs well for company margins. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector has been rising. It bodes well for new investment activity in creating additional capacity. Credit growth in the industry has also increased remarkably, suggesting that prospects for Capex investments by companies are brighter. The PLI schemes are set to unlock manufacturing capacity, boost exports, reduce import dependence and lead to job creation for both skilled and unskilled labour. On the downside, exports are slowing down and are likely to moderate along with the probable global economic slowdown. V olatile international commodity prices and supply disruptions in raw materials can weigh on industrial growth in the wake of new disruptions at the global level. The re-emergence of Covid-19 in China can trigger supply chain disruptions, as was the case during the pandemic period. On the other hand, if China returns to normalcy from Covid-19, there can be an increase in commodity demand - thus reversing the recent decline in commodity prices. Of course, the strength and duration of the recovery in commodity prices will be a function of many factors, such as the pace of China’s economic recovery and growth outlook in North America and Europe. Notwithstanding such open questions, industrial output in India should continue to grow steadily based on resilient domestic demand.  CHAPTER10\nIndia’ s services sector witnessed a swift rebound in FY22 driven by growth in the contact-\nintensive services sub-sector, which bore the maximum burden of the pandemic. This sub-sector completely recovered from the pre-pandemic level in Q2 of FY23, driven by the release of pent-up demand, ease of mobility restriction, and near-universal vaccination coverage. Going forward, strong momentum growth and an uptick in the High-Frequency Indicators (HFIs) for the contact-intensive services sector reflect a strong growth opportunity in the next fiscal. PMI services, indicative of service sector activity, has also witnessed a strong rebound in recent months with the retreating of the price pressures of inputs and raw materials.\nIndia has been a major player in services trade, being among the top ten services exporting \ncountries in 2021, having increased its share in world commercial services exports from 3 per cent in 2015 to 4 per cent in 2021. India’ s services exports have remained resilient during the Covid-19 pandemic and amid current geopolitical uncertainties, driven by higher demand for digital support, cloud services, and infrastructure modernisation catering to new challenges. \nTo ensure the liberalisation of investment in various industries, the Government has permitted \n100 per cent foreign participation in telecommunication services including all services and infrastructure providers, through the Automatic Route. The FDI ceiling in insurance companies was also raised from 49 to 74 per cent. Measures undertaken by the Government, such as the launch of the National Single-Window system and enhancement in the FDI ceiling through the automatic route, have played a significant role in facilitating investment.  \nWith the waning of the pandemic and external shocks on account of the Russia-Ukraine \nconflict, there is evidence of improvement in the performance of various services sub-sectors. The hotel industry is thriving with improvements in occupancy rate, increase in the Average Room Rate (ARR) and rise in Revenue Per Available Room (RevP AR) which are now much nearer to the pre-pandemic level of FY20. The tourism sector is also showing signs of revival, with foreign tourist arrivals in India in FY23 growing month-on-month with the resumption of scheduled international flights and the easing of Covid-19 regulations. The Real Estate sector has witnessed resilient growth in the current year, with housing sales and the launch of new houses surpassing in Q2 of FY23 the pre-pandemic level of Q2 of FY20. Information Technology-Business Process Management (IT-BPM) and the E-commerce industry have been exceptionally resilient during the Covid-19 pandemic, driven by accelerated technology adoption and digital transformation. The Government’ s push to boost the digital economy, growing internet penetration, rise in smartphone adoption and increased adoption of digital ServiceS : Source of \nStrength293\nServices: Source of Strength\npayments have also given a renewed push to these industries. The introduction and piloting \nof Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) will also provide a significant boost to digital financial services. They may lay the framework for another generation of financial innovation.\nintroduction\n10.1 The Covid-19 pandemic hurt most sectors of the economy, with the effect particularly \nprofound for contact-intensive services sectors like tourism, retail trade, hotel, entertainment, and recreation. On the other hand, non-contact services such as information, communication, financial, professional, and business services remained resilient. However, the services sector witnessed a swift rebound in FY22, growing Year-on-Year (YoY) at 8.4 per cent compared to a contraction of 7.8 per cent in the previous financial year. The improvement was driven by growth in the ‘Trade, Hotel, Transport, Storage, Communication and Services related to broadcasting’ sub-sector, which bore the maximum burden of the pandemic. The growth momentum has continued in FY23 as well. As per the First Advance Estimates, Gross Value Added (GV A) in the services sector is estimated to grow at 9.1 per cent in FY23, driven by 13.7 per cent growth in contact-intensive services sector.\nfigure X.1: Broad-based growth in the Services sector\n -30-20-1001020\n0102030\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2\n2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23\nPer cent  ₹ Lakh Crore  GVA in Services sector YoY growth (RHS)\nSource: NSO, MOSPI\n10.2 Even on a sequential basis, the rebound continued in Q2 of FY23, with the services sector \nrecording 8.7 per cent sequential growth. The contact-intensive services sub-sector completely \nrecovered the pre-pandemic level and registered sequential growth of 16 per cent, driven by the release of pent-up demand, ease of mobility restriction, and near-universal vaccination coverage. Going forward, the buoyant recovery of the contact-intensive services sector, accompanied by the robust performance of HFIs, suggests that the sector is likely to be the growth driver in the next fiscal.294\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nfigure X.2: the services sector witnessed strong growth momentum in Q2 of fY23.\n -30-20-1001020\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2\n2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23Per cent  YoY growth Sequential growth\n\u2003 Source: NSO, MOSPI\n10.3 The following sections discuss the trend in various HFIs to track the growth momentum of \nthe services sector as a whole and also discuss the performance of various services sub-sectors.  \ntrends in high-frequency indicators\nServices PMi\n10.4 India’s services sector activity, gauged by PMI Services, which remained in the \ncontractionary zone for several months during 2020 and 2021 on account of the restrictions \nimposed to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, recovered swiftly with the waning of the Omicron variant at the beginning of 2022. However, PMI services again witnessed a setback with the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The indicator moderated from May to September 2022 as economic uncertainty resulted in weaker sales growth and inflationary pressures restricting the upturn in business activity. Further, price pressures and unfavourable weather also dampened domestic demand. However, following an overall easing of retail inflation leading to retreating price pressures of inputs and raw materials, PMI services witnessed an uptick and expanded to 58.5 in December 2022.\nfigure X.3: PMi Services remained in an expansionary zone despite geopolitical tensions\n 010203040506070\nMar-19\nJun-19\nSep-19\nDec-19\nMar-20\nJun-20\nSep-20\nDec-20\nMar-21\nJun-21\nSep-21\nDec-21\nMar-22\nJun-22\nSep-22\nDec-22Index (50=Neutral)  \nLock Down  1 \n2nd Covid Omicron  \nwave  \n\u2003\u2003\u2003Source: IHS Markit295\nServices: Source of Strength\nBank credit\n10.5 Bank credit to the services sector has witnessed significant growth since October 2021 \nwith the improvement in vaccination coverage and recovery in the services sector.

Within the services sector, credit to wholesale and retail trade increased by 10.2 per cent and 21.9 per cent in November 2022, respectively, reflecting the strength of the underlying economic activity. Credit to NBFCs grew by 32.9 per cent as NBFCs shifted to bank borrowings because of high bond yields. Uncertain growth prospects in the global markets and uneven credit allocation to the transport sector led to a decline in credit to the shipping and aviation sector by 7.9 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively in November 2022.\nfigure X.4: credit offtake by the services sector registering double-digit growth since April 2022\n \n 0510152025\n010203040\nJan-21\nMar-21\nMay-21\nJul-21\nSep-21\nNov-21\nJan-22\nMar-22\nMay-22\nJul-22\nSep-22\nNov-22\nPer cent  ₹ Lakh Crore  Bank Credit to Services sector YoY growth (RHS)\n  Source: RBI\nServices trade\n10.6 World services trade volume finally surpassed its pre-pandemic peak in the second quarter \nof 2022 and was expected to remain strong in the third quarter, buoyed by spending on travel, \nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) services, and financial services. However, WTO’s Services Trade Barometer Index reading fell to 98.3 for October 2022 (slightly below its baseline value of 100), well below the previous reading of 105.5 in June 2022 indicating that YoY growth in real commercial services began moderating in the third quarter of 2022 and may slow further in the fourth as well as into the first quarter of 2023 due to declining growth prospects in major service industry economies. Financial and ICT Services have been so far most resilient to the slowing global economy, whereas, construction services and container shipping fell into contraction territory. \n10.7 Insofar as India is concerned, some headwinds may be observed in the coming months \nbecause of the slowing growth in some of India’s major trading partners. On the contrary, India’s \nservices exports may improve as runaway inflation in advanced economies drives up wages and makes local sourcing expensive, opening up avenues for outsourcing to low-wage countries, including India. India is a significant player in services trade, being among the top ten services 296\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nexporter countries in 2021, having increased its share in world commercial services exports \nfrom 3 per cent in 2015 to 4 per cent in 2021. A further increase in the share is likely, with the services exports registering growth of 27.7 per cent during April-December 2022 as compared to 20.4 per cent in the corresponding period last year. \n10.8 Among services exports, software exports have remained relatively resilient during the \nCovid-19 pandemic as well as amid current geopolitical uncertainties, driven by higher demand \nfor digital support, cloud services, and infrastructure modernisation catering to new challenges. Transport and travel exports have been the most impacted sub-components of the services exports in FY21 and FY22, which contracted due to the imposition of restrictions on international travel and tourism during the Covid-19 pandemic. If there is a meaningful economic slowdown in advanced nations, tourism and travel earnings in FY24 may be on the lower side.\nfigure X.5: Services exports remained resilient amid geopolitical uncertainties.\n 051015202530\nMar-19\nJun-19\nSep-19\nDec-19\nMar-20\nJun-20\nSep-20\nDec-20\nMar-21\nJun-21\nSep-21\nDec-21\nMar-22\nJun-22\nSep-22\nDec-22USD BillionNet services receipts Service Exports Service Imports\nSource: RBI\nforeign Direct investment (fDi) in Services\n10.9 The World Investment Report 2022 of UNCTAD places India as the seventh largest \nrecipient of FDI in the top 20 host countries in 2021.

To facilitate investment, various measures have been undertaken by the Government, such as the launch of the National Single-Window system, a one-stop solution for approvals and clearances needed by investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses. To ensure the liberalisation of investment in various industries, the Government has permitted 100 per cent foreign participation in telecommunication services, including all services and infrastructure providers, through the Automatic Route. The FDI ceiling in insurance companies was also raised from 49 to 74 per cent, under Automatic Route. Further, Government has allowed 20 per cent foreign investment in Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) under the automatic route.297\nServices: Source of Strength\nBox X.1: initiatives in the insurance Sector by the insurance regulatory \nand Development Authority of india (irDAi) in fY231\nThe Indian Insurance sector is at an inflexion point. India will be one of the main drivers of global \ninsurance industry growth over the next decade. Indian Insurance Market is the 10th largest in the \nworld and is poised to become the 6th largest by 2032, ahead of Germany, Canada, Italy, and South Korea\n2. The insurance regulator, IRDAI, has taken up the mission of universal insurance, which is \nexpected to lead to a significant increase in insurance penetration such that, when India celebrates 100 years of its independence in 2047, every Indian has appropriate life, health, and property insurance \ncover and every enterprise is supported by appropriate insurance solutions. Towards this objective, \nthe insurance regulator has taken various steps to promote healthy growth of the insurance industry, rationalise the regulatory framework, and reduce the compliance burden of regulated entities. \nIn line with the Government of India’s vision towards Financial Inclusion and a strong emphasis \non accelerating reforms, IRDAI, during FY23, has implemented the following measures to \nincrease accessibility, innovation, competition, distribution efficiency, and choice availability while \nmainstreaming technology and moving towards principle-based regime: -\n i.  easy entry into the insurance sector: A Single Window NOC Portal (www.noc.irdai.gov.in) was \nlaunched to facilitate the incorporation of an insurer by making the NOC available in a hassle-free \nand timely manner. \n ii.  Quick launch of insurance Products: Insurers can now launch all Health & General Insurance \nproducts, as well as the majority of Life Insurance products, without seeking prior approval from IRDAI, thereby reducing the time taken to launch a new product in the market from a few months \nto a few days. \n iii.  ease of doing business:  IRDAI has taken several actions to lessen the burden of compliance. In \nthis direction, so far, 70 returns have been rationalised, and about 85 circulars have been repealed \nwhile dispensing with the prior approval requirements in certain identified areas. \n iv.  Providing further impetus to the industry: Given that the sector has reached a level of maturity \nthat may not necessitate closer supervision, more flexibility to the regulated entities in the areas of \noperational and business decisions is being considered. \n v.  Addressing dynamic needs of the industry:  IRDAI has facilitated various measures as per the evolving needs of the sector, such as Tech-based add-ons (General insurers have been permitted \nto introduce tech-enabled concepts for Motor Insurance such as  Pay as You Drive, Pay How You \nDrive, etc.), expansion in the scope of the cashless facility in health insurance, Innovative products \nin Fire Insurance, Ease of living for Senior Citizen.\nMajor Services: Sub-Sector-Wise Performance\ntourism and hotel industry\n10.10  The post-pandemic scenario of global tourism is gradually converging to the pre-pandemic \none. With travel restrictions and health concerns subsiding, tourism has become a vital driver of \na strong upswing in contact-intensive activity. As per the World Tourism Barometer of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (November 2022), international tourism showed robust performance in January-September 2022, with international tourist arrivals reaching 63 per cent of the pre-pandemic level in the first nine months of 2022, boosted by strong pent-up demand, improved confidence levels and the lifting of restrictions. The pace of recovery would have been even stronger but for the lingering global uncertainties and higher inflation in advanced nations. \n1Until October 2022   \n2Sigma Report (No 4/2022) by Swiss Re (Page no 15) 298\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n10.11  The Covid-19 pandemic affected the fortunes of the hospitality and tourism industries in \nrecent years. The hotel industry closed the year 2020 with an average hotel occupancy rate of 33-\n36 per cent, reflecting a decline of 32 per cent3. In the wake of falling demand and occupancies, \nhotels reduced tariffs significantly to attract business, thus, pulling down Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) to a dismal low of ₹1,500 - ₹1,800, a decline of around 57-59 per cent. However, hotel occupancy began a strong recovery in the third quarter of 2021\n4, driven by domestic leisure \ntravel growth, partial resumption of business travel in the country, as well as wedding and social events. Small-to-medium-sized domestic MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conference, Exhibitions) events also made a comeback, fuelling demand for hotels. The sector ended the year with an average occupancy of 42-45 per cent, up 10-13 percentage points over the previous year. \n10.12  The reintroduction of travel restrictions across States at the beginning of 2022 due to the \nemergence of a new Covid-19 strain, Omicron, again threw the Indian hospitality sector into an \nupheaval. Other leisure and business travel plans were put on hold, barring critical and urgent travel as people exercised caution. The low demand resulted in an average hotel occupancy rate of 50 per cent during January-March 2022. However, due to the lower severity and hospitalisation rate of the Omicron variant, travel demand in India began its return to normalcy in March 2022. Aiding the revival of travel demand was the high vaccination rate in the country, as also effective pandemic management that ensured speed in imposing as well as the lifting of mobility restrictions closely tracking the spread and subsiding of the virus. After a two-year hiatus, India also resumed all regular international flights at full capacity as 2021-22 came to a close. Consequently, the entire aircraft movement (cargo aircraft + passenger aircraft) in the country increased by 52.9 per cent YoY between April and November 2022, reaching 93.9 per cent of the movement recorded between April and November 2019. Presently, the hotel industry is thriving with improvements in occupancy rate, an increase in Average Room Rate (ARR) and a rise in RevPAR\n5. The occupancy \nrate in November 2022 stood at around 68-70 per cent, completely recovering the average pre-pandemic level of 2019-20. \n10.13  Tourism industry was another sector that was adversely impacted by the pandemic. A \nsignificant decline in Foreign Tourist Arrivals in India was witnessed in FY21. As per a study\n6 \nconducted by the Ministry of Tourism in collaboration with the National Council of Applied and \nEconomic Research (NCAER), Tourism Direct Gross Value Added (TDGV A) witnessed a decline of 42.8 per cent in Q1, 15.5 per cent in Q2, and 1.1 per cent in  Q3 of FY21 due to the overall economic slowdown in FY21. Tourism being a contact-intensive sector, employment in the sector was impacted due to the lockdown, and it was a global phenomenon. 14.5 million direct jobs in Q1, 5.2 million in Q2, and 1.8 million in Q3 are expected to have been lost compared to an estimated 34.8 million direct jobs in the tourism sector in the pre-pandemic period of FY20.\n10.14  However, with the waning of the pandemic, India’s tourism sector is also showing signs \nof revival. Foreign tourist arrivals in India in FY23 have been growing month-on-month with \nthe resumption of scheduled international flights and the easing of Covid-19 regulations. Yet, the arrivals are below the pre-pandemic level.

Several factors, such as the presence of world-class hospitals and \nskilled medical professionals, superior quality healthcare, low treatment costs compared with other countries, credibility in alternative systems of medicine, and increased global demand for wellness services like Yoga and meditation, make India a popular medical tourism destination.\nfigure X.8: foreign tourist Arrivals (ft As) in india are catching-up with the pre-pandemic levels\n 04812\nApr-20\nJun-20\nAug-20\nOct-20\nDec-20\nFeb-21\nApr-21\nJun-21\nAug-21\nOct-21\nDec-21\nFeb-22\nApr-22\nJun-22\nAug-22\nOct-22Lakh  Foreign Tourist Arrivals Average 2019 levels\nSource: Ministry of Tourism300\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n10.16 India has also attempted to improve its attractiveness as a destination for specialised \ntourism. Recent initiatives like the Ayush visa for tourists who desire to visit India for medical \ntreatment, the launch of the National Strategy for Sustainable Tourism & Responsible Traveller Campaign, the introduction of the Swadesh Darshan 2.0 scheme, and Heal in India can assist in capturing a larger share of the global medical tourism market. Going forward, the G20 presidency presents a unique opportunity for the Indian travel and tourism industry to take advantage of this chance to promote India as a "major tourism destination", which is likely to positively impact passenger travel and hotel occupancy rate.\nBox X.2: Making india an attractive tourist destination\nThe Ministry of Tourism has undertaken various measures to boost the Tourism sector, which include: -\nniDhi: The Ministry of Tourism, with the help of State Governments and Union Territory \nAdministrations, is making efforts to register accommodation units in the country in the Ministry’s \nportal National Integrated Database of Hospitality Industry (NIDHI). The comprehensive national \ndatabase will help in creating policies and strategies for the promotion and development of tourism at various destinations. \nSAA thi: System for Assessment, Awareness, and Training for Hospitality Industry (SAATHI) was \nlaunched in association with the Quality Council of India to restrict any further transmission of the \nvirus while providing accommodation and other services post-lockdown. The objective of the scheme \nis to sensitise the industry on the Covid-19 regulations of the government and instil confidence amongst \nthe staff and guests that the hospitality unit has exhibited intent towards ensuring safety and hygiene at the workplace.\nrcS uDAn3:  Better connectivity is the critical component for flourishing tourism in any region. \nWith this objective, the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS- UDAN) was launched by the Ministry \nof Civil Aviation to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. The total \nnumber of Tourism RCS air routes has increased to 59, out of which 51 are presently operational. An \namount of ₹104.19 core has already been reimbursed to the Airport Authority of India in the form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF) during FY21 and FY22.\nLgScA tSS: Under the Loan Guarantee Scheme for Covid Affected Tourism Service Sector \n(LGSCATSS) administered through the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company (NCGTC), \nworking capital/personal loans are provided to households that were impacted due to the Covid-19 pandemic to discharge liabilities and restart businesses. The scheme was launched to cover 10,700 Regional Level Tourist Guides (recognised by the Ministry of Tourism), Tourist Guides (recognised by the State Governments/ UT Administration), and about 1,000 Travel and Tourism Stakeholders (TTS) \n(recognised by the Ministry of Tourism). \nTo boost the tourism sector, the first 5 lakh Tourists Visa were announced by the Government for \ntourists of foreign nationals visiting India. The scheme was applicable until 31st March 2022 or until 5 \nlakh free visas were issued, whichever is earlier. The benefit was available only once per tourist. \nreal estate\n10.17 The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic accentuated a slowdown in every economic space, \nand the real estate sector was no different. Project delays, deferment of big-ticket purchases, \nstagnation of property prices, and scarce funding for developers induced slackening of demand. The situation was further aggravated by the associated lockdown and migration of workforces 301\nServices: Source of Strength\ninvolved in the sector to their natives. The work-from-home model had an impact on the demand \nfor office space requirements by the corporates. \n10.18 The Pandemic, however, brought about a change in individual home buyers’ sentiment \nin favour of owning a house. With the easing of curbs, there was an increase in interest in the \nresidential housing sector and more so in the readily available and affordable segment. The hybrid work mode with the privileges of working from anywhere encouraged first-time home buyers to move away from the conventional metros, and this brought about a pent-up demand in the residential real estate markets of Tier II and III cities. Improvement in affordability in response to measures taken by the government during the pandemic, such as lower interest rates, reduction in circle rates, and cut in stamp duties on transaction of sale/purchase of immovable property, the extension of the Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) also played a significant role in post-pandemic rebound of Real Estate sector.\nBox X.3: Measures taken by the government to boost the housing sector\nThe various policy intervention by the government, including ‘Housing for All’, Aatmanirbhar Bharat, etc., provided an impetus to the Housing Finance sector. The permission by RBI to lending institutions to grant a total moratorium of 6 (3+3) months in case of payment failure \ndue \nbetween 1st March 2020 to 31st August 2020, infusion of ₹75,000 crore for Non-Banking Financial \nCorporations (NBFCs), Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) and Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs), \namong others, have also contributed to the revival of the real estate sector.\nThe interest subvention under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme \nUrban) (PMAY-CLSS (U)) has been the demand-side driver in the residential housing space. \nThis, along with streamlined policies to increase the credit flow, has helped in the creation of a \nconsumer-friendly ecosystem for housing finance. Since its inception, the government has released \na subsidy amounting to ₹ 53,548 crore benefitting approximately 22.87 lakh households. Further, \nthe Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) created sufficient liquidity in the sector for viable growth. Under the Affordable Housing Fund, National Housing Bank has disbursed ₹ 34,588 crore for \n3.9 lakh dwelling units since its inception. Under the Special Liquidity Facility of RBI, National \nHousing Bank (NHB) disbursed ₹13,917 crore and ₹8,112 crore during the 1st and 2nd waves of the pandemic, respectively, to ensure seamless business as usual in the sector. Including the \nabove, National Housing bank has provided Liquidity support of ₹ 88,400 crore through various \nrefinance schemes since the onset of the Pandemic.\nThe concessional liquidity provided the sector with the much-needed liquidity influx for keeping the \nsector resilient. The Co-lending model has been put forward with the aim to leverage the liquidity \nbase of the banks and reach of HFCs to deliver formal housing credit to the bottom of the pyramid. The Smart City Project, with a plan to build 100 smart cities across India, was aimed at improving the \noverall opportunity for the real estate sector and encouraging investments. The overall affordability in \nthe residential real estate sector was high during the post-pandemic period, as reflected by a decline in the weighted average annual interest rate on home loans from 8.6 per cent during January-March 2020 \nto 7.3 per cent during January-March 2022 for Scheduled Commercial Banks. Also, with a consistent \nthrust on affordable housing and a series of measures taken by the Government and the Regulators, the sector bounced back, registering a more robust growth with consistent improvement in sales as well as \nnew launches.302\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n10.19 The geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine have again raised concerns \nregarding disruption in the global supply chain and its consequent impact on the real estate \nsector. With a volatile international market, the surge in prices of construction materials has pushed developers to halt ongoing construction. The Wholesale Price Index for Cement, Lime & Plaster has increased from 127.1 in December 2021 to 137.6 during December 2022, indicating an uptick in the input cost for construction. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has further affected the supply chain resulting in price escalations of steel, cement, finishing materials, imported chemicals, and fuel, thereby increasing the overall construction cost and resulting in a rise in housing prices. \n10.20 Notwithstanding the current impediments, such as rising interest rates on home loans and \nan increase in property prices, the sector has witnessed resilient growth in the current year, with \nhousing sales and the launch of new houses in Q2 of FY23 surpassing the pre-pandemic level of Q2 of FY20. There is evidence of a significant decline in the inventory overhang\n9 dipping to 33 \nmonths during Q3 of FY23 from 42 months last year. The unsold inventory stood at 8.5 lakh at the end of 2022 with 80 per cent of the stocks under various stages of construction. This comes on the back of sustained sales momentum as the sector steadily recovers from the impact of the pandemic. Going forward, the recent government measures, such as the reduction in import duties on steel products, iron ore, and steel intermediaries, will cool off the construction cost and help to check the rise in housing prices.\nfigure X.9: Sustained growth in housing \nsales and launches, surpassing the  \npre-pandemic levelfigure X.10: the decline in  \ninventory overhang\n 04080120160\nQ1\nQ2Q3\nQ4\nQ1Q2\nQ3\nQ4Q1\nQ2\nQ3Q4Q1\nQ2\nQ3\n2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23Thousand  New launches Sales\n 0102030405060\n0246810\nQ1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3 Q1 Q3\n2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-\n23\nPer cent  Lakh  Unsold Inventory\nInventory Overhang (RHS)\nSource: Prop Tiger\n10.21 According to JLL’s 2022 Global Real Estate Transparency Index10 11, India’s real estate \nmarket transparency is among the top ten most improved markets globally, with its composite \n9Inventory overhang refers to the estimated time period developers are likely to take to sell off the unsold inventory, based on the current sales  \n velocity.\n10The Global Real Estate Transparency Index is based on a combination of quantitative market data and survey results across 94 countries  \n  and 156 city markets.

With rapid digitisation across the value chain, end-user industries are primed to adopt holistic and high-end enterprise performance solutions in an evolutionary journey over the near to long term.\n10.23 According to NASSCOM’s report\n12, India’s IT-BPM industry has been exceptionally \nresilient during the pandemic, driven by increased technology spending, accelerated technology \nadoption, and digital transformation. This is evident in the swift and wide-scale remote working adoption of one of the world’s largest IT workforces. Capitalising on the learnings from the first wave, the industry’s response to the second wave has moved beyond addressing the immediate challenges to significantly enhancing capabilities to become a future-ready organisation. An obsession with customer-centricity, domain-specific solutions, a digital-first talent pool, and a laser-sharp focus on creating future-ready solutions have been the key pillars that enabled technology firms to respond proactively to emerging customer demand throughout the pandemic.\n10.24  IT-BPM revenues registered YoY growth of 15.5 per cent during FY22 compared to 2.1 \nper cent growth in FY21, with all sub-sectors showing double-digit revenue growth. Within the IT-\nBPM sector, IT services constitute the majority share (greater than 51 per cent). Exports (including hardware) witnessed a growth of 17.2 per cent in FY22 compared to 1.9 per cent growth in FY21, owing to the increased reliance of businesses on technology, the roll-out of cost-reducing deals\n13  \n12 https://nasscom.in/knowledge-center /publications/technology-sector-india-2022-strategic-review\n13  Cost-reducing deals refer to business deals which result in a decline in the company’s expenses to maximise profits.

Growth in exports was seen across all the major markets, with \nthe USA, Europe (excl. UK), and the UK continues to be the major markets. Many firms are now focusing on new markets, more prominently the Middle East and Latin America leading to market diversification which will increase the IT-BPM sector’s resilience in the coming years. The industry recorded nearly 10 per cent estimated growth in direct employee pool in FY22 with a highest-ever net addition to its employee base. The domestic technology industry is estimated to grow at 10 per cent on account of enterprise digital acceleration and transformation. \nfigure X.12: geographic distribution of \nit-BPM exports (excluding hardware)figure X.13: Segment-wise break-up \nof revenues in fY22\n \n62% 17% 11% 8% 2% \nUSA\n UK\nEurope (excl.

India’s massive digital infrastructure played a crucial role in driving \ntechnology adoption, with public digital platforms becoming the bedrock of India’s digital advantage.  However, NASSCOM’s quarterly review in August 2022 indicates that technology spending during FY23 is likely to see a relatively muted growth dampened by an expected global slowdown.\nBox X.4: Major growth drivers in the it -BPM industry\n•   increasing penetration of digital tech and “Made in india digital-first solutions for the \nworld.” \nIn India, the proportion of digital revenue as a percentage of total revenue has increased from around 26-28 per cent in FY20 to 30-32 per cent in FY22. In recent years, India has emerged as a global powerhouse for Engineering R&D (ER&D) and innovation and is steadfastly committed to ushering future growth and innovation for global enterprises. Many Global Competency Centres (GCCs) have been incorporated in India in the last six years. GCCs in India are increasingly performing complex R&D functions and are leveraging futuristic technologies and developing digitally innovative products as well building either the largest or the second-largest ER&D hubs in India. Patent filing has increased drastically, with over 138,000 patents filed between 2015- 21, with over 85,000 filed in emerging technologies. 305\nServices: Source of Strength\n•  Margin defence through operational excellence  \nMargin defence has been the critical focus amidst supply challenges as growing demand for \ntech talent puts pressure on margins with a limited opportunity to pass on the cost increase. Key margin levers include increased capacity utilisation, a higher share of offshore revenue, a declining share of travel and facility costs, and operating leverage.\n•  india is a digital talent nation \nIndia has emerged as a digital talent nation with a high share of the working population and growing undergraduate enrolments. Employment across technology companies witnessed an increase, with an uptrend in the digital talent base. New talent hiring from tier-2 cities, with a focus on reskilling non-tech talent, has led India to evolve as a significant sub-contractor base, with more women gett ing back into the workforce.\n•  Leading in hybrid work models \nIndian tech industry led the adoption of hybrid work models. The technology used for \naugmenting employee experience and integrating tech solutions in aspects such as employee onboarding, communication, collaboration, and employee well-being & enablement has \nbeen the major driver. The HR functions at organisations are undergoing a transformation journey; the organisations are moving forward with an objective to deliver cost savings while expanding services and improving experiences by using a combination of labour arbitrage, optimised workforce models, elimination of low-value vendor spends, increasing talent liquidity and reducing people space cost.\ne-commerce\n10.26 On the same lines as the IT-BPM sector, the E-Commerce sector also witnessed a \nrenewed push and a sharp increase in penetration in the aftermath of the pandemic. Lockdowns \nand mobility restrictions disrupted consumer behaviour and gave an impetus to online shopping. The Government’s push to boost the digital economy, growing internet penetration, rise in smartphone adoption, innovation in mobile technologies, and increased adoption of digital payments further accelerated the adoption and growth of e-commerce. According to the Global Payments Report by Worldpay FIS, India’s e-commerce market is projected to post impressive gains and grow at 18 per cent annually through 2025.\n10.27  The expansion of e-commerce to newer segments like grocery, fresh-to-home fruits and \nvegetables, and general merchandise has contributed to the expansion of the customer base beyond \ntraditional buyers. And as per the latest report ‘How India Shops Online 2022’ by Bain & Company, emerging categories – fashion, grocery, general merchandise – would shore up e-commerce growth in India and would capture nearly two-thirds of the Indian e-commerce market by 2027.\n10.28 There has also been an increase in the adoption of digital solutions by Micro, Small and \nMedium Enterprises (MSMEs) like e-commerce and e-procurement, realising the prospects of \nincreased revenues and margins, improved market reach, access to new markets, and customer acquisition. A recent study by IIFT analysing the impact of the interaction between MSMEs and e-commerce found that in recent years, MSMEs that adopted digital solutions fared far better than offline MSMEs, assisting them in accessing a large marketplace without incurring huge costs. The E-commerce platform has not only empowered small businesses by removing geographical barriers and providing a large customer base but also allowed them to deal directly 306\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nwith manufacturers and suppliers, thus reducing the cost of procurement. This increased access \nto suppliers significantly helps small business owners scale up their businesses at a much lower investment level, thus boosting their cost structure.\n10.29 Further, there has been a phenomenal geographical expansion with the growth of \ne-commerce business in rural India driven by increased smartphone penetration, internet \nadoption, and increased purchasing power of rural customers. In addition, fiscal support during the pandemic helped boost e-commerce penetration in rural areas, likely by increasing consumption, which could mostly be done online in the presence of pandemic restrictions. A vast untapped rural market holds the potential for strengthening consumption growth; new E-commerce companies like Trell, Meesho, and shop 101, are expanding and gaining popularity in Tier 3 and 4 cities. The E-commerce industry is focusing on local solutions to penetrate rural areas by strengthening the network of rural distributors and retailers and using local distribution centres as Pick Up Drop Off points, enabling logistics companies to serve rural consumers.\nfigure X.14: fashion, grocery, and general merchandise to capture \nnearly two-thirds of the indian e-commerce market by 2027     \n Mobiles/E\nlectronics/\nAppliance\ns (25% -\n30%)  \nFashion \n(25% -\n30%) Grocery/G\neneral \nMerchandi\nse (30% -\n35%) Other \n(10% -\n15%) \n2027 \n Mobiles/\nElectronic\ns/Applian\nces (45% -\n50%)  \nFashion \n(20% -\n25%)  Grocery/G\neneral \nMerchandi\nse (20% -\n25%)  Other \n(5%-\n10%)  \n2022 \nSource: How India Shops Online 2022, Bain and Company\n10.30 In terms of order volume and valuation, post-Covid-19 years have been the most \nsuccessful years for Indian E-commerce start-ups. As per the Retail and E-commerce Trends report released by Unicommerce and Wazir Advisors\n14, overall e-commerce order volume \nwitnessed a growth of 69.4 per cent YoY in FY22, driven mainly by consumers from tier-II and tier-III cities in the last two years. The shoppers from tier-II and tier-III cities accounted for over 61.3 per cent of the overall market share in FY22, increasing from 53.8 per cent in FY21. The order volume from tier-II and tier-III cities grew at almost double the pace of tier-I cities, with 92.2 per cent and 85.2 per cent YoY growth, respectively, in FY22. In contrast, tier-I cities indicated a comparatively slower order volume growth rate of 47.2 per cent.\n10.31 The Government E-Marketplace (GeM) has also witnessed tremendous growth in \nGross Merchandise Value (GMV) and is catching up with E-commerce giants like Amazon and \n14 https://retail.economictimes.india times.com/files/cp/1294/cdoc-1661333692-ECOM_july_7_5in%20x%208in_Correction.pdf307\nServices: Source of Strength\nFlipkart. GeM attained an annual procurement of ₹1 lakh crore within FY22, representing a \n160 per cent growth compared to last FY . GeM has taken a host of steps to onboard products of Self-Help Groups (SHGs), tribal communities, artisans, weavers, and MSMEs. 57 per cent of the total business on GeM has come through the MSME units, and female entrepreneurs have contributed over 6 per cent.\n10.32 Initiatives taken by the Government for the promotion of e-Commerce, including the \nDigital India program, Unified Payment Interface (UPI), GeM, etc., have been major contributory \nfactors to the growth of E-commerce in recent years. Various initiatives have also been taken to provide an opportunity to small retailers, manufacturers, and Self-Help Groups for greater outreach. One District – One Product (ODOP) initiative has been facilitating the onboarding of sellers of identified products on e-Commerce platforms to provide greater visibility for small businesses from the rural sector. E-marketplace www.tribesindia.com portal through Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Limited (TRIFED) has been onboarding tribal artisans with their products for online sales, ensuring tribal products find a larger audience in the international market as well. \n10.33 The recent initiative of the launch of Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) \nis also playing a significant role in democratising digital payments, enabling interoperability, \nand bringing down transaction costs. ONDC provides better market access to sellers and helps bring the country\'s remotest corners into the e-Commerce framework by empowering them with digitisation. Details on the applicability and advantages of ONDC are further discussed in  \nCh-12 on Physical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth. \nDigital financial Services\n10.34 Digital financial services enabled by emerging technologies and innovative solutions \nare accelerating financial inclusion, democratising access, and spurring the personalisation of products. With a strong foundation provided by the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity, UPI, and other regulatory frameworks, the pandemic has aided acceleration in digital adoption and provided a fillip to digital financial services solutions by banks, NBFCs, insurers as well as fintech. The pandemic provided the opportunity for fintech companies to reach the underserved and provide cost-effective financial services to those at the bottom of the pyramid. While globally, the technological solutions cushioned the reverberations of the pandemic, India took the lead with the fintech adoption rate of 87 per cent, substantially higher than the world average of 64 per cent as per the latest Global FinTech Adoption Index\n15.\n10.35 Over the last few years, the number of neobanking platforms and global investments \nin the neo-banking segment has also risen consistently. Neobanks operate under mainstream finance\'s umbrella but empower specific services long associated with traditional institutions such as banks, payment providers, etc. Neobanks operate entirely online, with no physical presence apart from office space in the offline world. The growth of these institutions is spurred by the need for on-demand and easier-to-access financial solutions by a young and increasingly digitally savvy demographic. Neobanks have eased availability and provided access to financial services to MSMEs and underbanked customers and areas. The government also, through various \n15 https://assets.ey.com/content/dam /ey-sites/ey-com/en_gl/topics/banking-and-capital-markets/ey-global-fintech-adoption-index.pdf308\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\ninitiatives, has given a push to digital banking solutions. 75 Digital Banking Units (DBU) across \n75 districts announced in Union Budget 2022-23 to take banking solutions to every nook and corner of the country have been launched.\n10.36 The introduction of CBDC will also significantly boost digital financial services. Issuance \nof CBDC in India offers several benefits, which inter alia, include reduction in operational \ncosts involved in physical cash management, fostering financial inclusion, bringing resilience, efficiency, and innovation in the payments system, boosting innovation in cross-border payments space, and providing public with uses that any private virtual currencies can provide, without the associated risks. As of July 2022, there are 105 countries in the process of exploring CBDC, a number that covers 95 per cent of the global GDP. Many countries have already launched the CBDC, while others are in the pilot stage. \n10.37 RBI has also recently launched pilots of CBDC in both the Wholesale and Retail segments. \nDigital Rupee –Wholesale- the pilot in the wholesale segment was launched on 1st November \n2022, with the use case being limited to the settlement of secondary market transactions in government securities. Use of Digital Rupee- Wholesale is expected to make the inter-bank market more efficient. The pilot in the retail segment, known as Digital Rupee-Retail kicked off on 1st December 2022, within a closed user group comprising participating customers and merchants. For full operationalisation of CBDC, RBI is gradually expanding the pilots\' scope to include more banks, users, and locations based on feedback received during the pilots.\n10.38 Digitalising documents has also played a pivotal role in giving further impetus to digital \nfinancial services. The digitisation of documents ensures safety, online verification, improved \naccessibility, and fraud reduction, enhancing use for end customers and the service provider.\nBox X.5: Account Aggregator framework:  \ntransforming india’s financial Services\nAccount Aggregator (AA) is a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) engaged in the \nbusiness of providing the service of retrieving or collecting financial information pertaining \nto the customer. No financial information of the customer is retrieved, shared or transferred \nby AA without the explicit consent of the customer. AA transfers data from one financial institution to another based on an individual\'s instruction and consent. Registering with \nan AA is fully voluntary for consumers. Entities may enrol themselves on AA framework \nas Financial Information Provider (FIP) viz. banking company, non-banking financial company, asset management company, depository, depository participant, insurance \ncompany, insurance repository, pension fund etc. and as Financial Information User (FIU) \nwhich is an entity registered with and regulated by any financial sector regulator. In this direction, RBI has issued the Master Direction viz Non-Banking Financial Company – \nAccount Aggregator (Reserve Bank) Directions, dated September 02, 2016. At present, RBI \nhas granted a Certificate of Registration to six companies as AA.\nAchievements so far\n• As on 31st December 2022, 27 Financial Institutions have gone live as FIPs, including \nall 12 PSBs, 10 Private Sector Banks, 1 Small Finance Bank, and 4 Life Insurance Companies.309\nServices: Source of Strength\n• 119 Financial Institutions have gone live as FIUs viz; 93 RBI Regulated, 12 SEBI \nRegulated, 12 IRDAI-regulated entities, and 2 PFRDA-regulated entities. \n• With 23 Banks onboarded to the Account Aggregator framework, more than 1.1 billion bank accounts are eligible to share data on AA. 3.3 million users have linked their accounts on the AA framework out of which 3.28 million users successfully shared data via AA. \nRBI has also notified Goods and Services Tax Network as FIP on 23rd November 2022 which will enable digital invoice financing and provide much-needed credit to the MSME sector.\nBox X.6: Dematerialisation of documents:  \nthe next wave of digitisation \nIn line with the objective of the Digital India mission, which seeks to transform India into a digitally empowered nation, National e-Governance Services Limited (NeSL), an Information Utility registered with and regulated by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India under the aegis of the IBC 2016, introduced the Digital Document Execution (DDE) platform in 2020. This was done at the behest of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India and with \nthe support of the Department of Financial Services (DFS), Ministry of Finance. \nThe core principle of the NeSL-DDE platform is to digitise all the steps of the document/\nagreement execution journey. These include: -\n• Submission of information and document/agreement to be executed on the platform\n• Flexibility to accommodate any agreement/document format\n• Consent-based process\n• Digital payment of stamp duty and affixing of digital e-stamp certificate\n• Verification of the identity of the executants and digital execution using an electronic  \n\u2003\u2003 signature• Secure storage transmission and retrieval of the digitally executed document generated  \n\u2003\u2003 using the platform\nThe NeSL-DDE platform eliminates the need for the physical presence of the executants and \nthe manual process to be carried out for executing documents/agreements. By doing so, the platform generates several benefits, such as lower execution time and cost, a secure system, authorised access, bulk processing, fraud prevention, legal robustness, and evidentiary value. A significant enabler in the journey of digitisation of documents/agreements in the financial sector is the use of the Aadhaar e-Sign, which has made electronic signatures widely available to citizens at a nominal cost.\nThe NeSL-DDE platform has garnered the support of state governments, ministries, and \nfinancial institutions. DFS has been encouraging banks to consider adopting DDE for their agreements. Currently, 23 States and Union Territories are available for digital e-stamping on the NeSL DDE platform. 27 banks and NBFCs are using the platform for executing their agreements, and so far, more than 9 lakh transactions have been undertaken. This includes small-ticket consumer lending transactions to large-value corporate lending transactions. 310\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nOne use case of the NeSL-DDE platform is the electronic bank guarantee (e-BG), which takes \naway all the issues and challenges associated with the issuance, transfer, and management of physical bank guarantees and brings inefficiencies of time and cost savings. As the adoption of e-BG picks up, the NeSL platform can also function as a central repository of bank guarantees. Recently, the Department of Expenditure has amended the General Financial Rules, 2017, to permit the acceptance of e-BG in the government procurement process.  \nWhile the initial use case of NeSL-DDE is financial documents/agreements, the platform \nshall also enable the digital execution of other documents/agreements. This secure, paperless, hassle-free contracting offered by NeSL-DDE will have significant implications on the ease of doing business in the nation.\noutlook\n10.39 India’s services sector growth which was highly volatile and fragile during the last \n2 fiscal years, has shown resilience in FY23 driven by the release of pent-up demand, ease of mobility restriction, near-universal vaccination coverage and pre-emptive government interventions. Broad-based recovery has been observed in recent months, with pick up in almost all sub-sectors especially contact intensive services sector, which bore the maximum brunt of the pandemic. This is reflective of an uptick in the performance of various HFIs, reflecting a solid upswing in recent months, hinting at an enhanced presentation of the services sector in the next fiscal. The prospects look bright with improved performance of various sub-sectors like Tourism, Hotel, Real estate, IT-BPM, E-commerce etc. The downside risk, however, lies in the external exogenous factors and bleak economic outlook in Advanced Economies impacting growth prospects of the services sector through trade and other linkages. CHAPTER11\nIndia’ s external sector has been buffeted by shocks and uncertainty manifested in terms of \nelevated, though now easing global commodity prices; tightening international financial \nconditions; heightening financial market volatility; reversal of capital flows; currency \ndepreciation, and looming global growth and trade slowdown. However, it has been able to face these headwinds from a position of strength on the back of strong macroeconomic \nfundamentals and buffers.\nDuring FY23 (till December 2022) India’ s exports have displayed resilience on the back \nof record levels of exports in FY22. Petroleum products, gems & jewellery, organic & \ninorganic chemicals, drugs & pharmaceuticals were among the leading export items. \nHowever, the slowdown in Indian exports is inevitable in a slowing global economy characterised by slowing global trade. Recognising the key role exports play in improving \nthe resilience of the external sector, from a medium to long-term perspective, various \nexport promotion measures are being considered/implemented. These measures would nurture the inherent comparative advantage that Indian exports embody. In addition, \nwhile National Logistics Policy would ease the domestic frictions to encourage Indian \nexports by reducing the cost of internal logistics, the latest Free Trade Agreements, such as with UAE and Australia, would address the external frictions by creating opportunities \nfor exports at concessional tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Thus, the whole ecosystem \nwould evolve in an export-friendly manner over time. \nApart from the elevated crude oil prices, the revival of economic activity contributed \nto an increase in imports. Petroleum, crude & products; electronic goods; coal, coke \n& briquettes, etc.; machinery, electrical & non-electrical and gold were among the top import items. While the continued softening of the global commodity price outlook would \nassist moderate imports going forward, non-gold, non-oil imports may not decelerate \nsignificantly. Further, efforts are underway to promote international trade settlement in Indian Rupees. Once these initiatives gain traction, dependence on foreign currency \nwould potentially reduce, making the economy less vulnerable to external shocks.  \nBalance of Payments (BoP) encountered pressures during the year under review. While \nthe impact of a sharp rise in oil prices was discernible in the widening of the Current \nAccount Deficit (CAD), notwithstanding the cushion provided by the surplus on Invisibles \n(services, transfer, and income), policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve and the strengthening of the US dollar led to Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) outflows. As a \nresult, the surplus of the capital account was lower than the CAD leading to a depletion \nof forex reserves on a BoP basis. However, going forward, the expected easing of crude oil ExtErnal SEctor:  \nwatchful and hopEful312\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nIntroduction\n11.1 Two global shocks in the new millennium – one an economic shock and the other, a health \nshock - have had very contrasting repercussions on the global economy. Following the global \nfinancial crisis in 2007-08 as the inflationary pressures were muted, interest rates were extremely low for long years. The easing financial conditions supported global economic growth, which reached 4.5 per cent in 2010. Now, the Covid-19 pandemic is another shock to global growth performance, with economic growth down to a negative of 3.8 per cent in 2020. The following two years saw inflation rates rise to multi-decade highs, fuelled by global commodity and food price spikes. The situation has been further amplified by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. To stem the situation, monetary authorities in advanced economies, especially the US Federal Reserve (US Fed), are accelerating the pace of monetary policy normalisation. The 10-year Treasury yield in the US increased almost six-fold between mid-2020 and mid-2022. Risk assets were sold off sharply triggering capital flight from many emerging and frontier market economies, bringing to a halt the rebound of net capital flows to developing countries observed since the last quarter of 2020. \n11.2 Interest rates and prices of risk assets have been extremely volatile since April 2022, \nreflecting heightened uncertainty about the economic and policy outlook, exacerbated by low \nliquidity. The US dollar appreciated sharply against currencies of Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) and major advanced economies facing high borrowing costs. Thus, global financial conditions have considerably tightened especially since April 2022, and the balance of risks is significantly skewed to the downside, thereby weakening the global economic outlook. Global growth is forecast to slow from 6.0 per cent in 2021 to 3.2 per cent in 2022 and 2.7 per cent in 2023 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n1 This is the weakest growth profile \nsince 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acute phase of the pandemic. Further, external public debt vulnerability concerns are being exacerbated as such debt in developing economies is at record levels presently and most of it is owed to private creditors, with much of it involving variable interest rates that could spike suddenly.\n2 Thus, emerging markets face a \nhost of risks emanating from elevated external borrowing costs, sticky high inflation, volatile commodity markets, uncertain global economic growth outlook, and spill overs from policy tightening in advanced economies.\n1World Economic Outlook Report, IMF, October 2022.\n2“South Asia’s Current Macroeconomic Challenges and Policy Priorities”, Keynote Address by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor, Reserve Bank \nof India –6 January  2023 - at the high-level Conference co-organised by IMF Asia and Pacific Department and IMF South Asia Regional \nTraining and Technical Assistance Centre, New Delhiprices, the resilience of net services exports and buoyant inward remittances would result \nin lower CAD during the remainder of FY23 and is expected to be within sustainable \nlimits. \nThe fortified shock absorbers of India’ s external sector are in place to cushion the global \nheadwinds be it the formidable forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, or \nmarket-determined exchange rate. While forex reserves as of the end December 2022 \nstood at US$ 562.72 billion, accounting for 9.3 months of imports, the ratio of external debt to GDP is at a comfortable level of 19.2 per cent as of end-September 2022.313\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\n11.3 Against this fast-evolving global backdrop, this chapter chronicles the developments in the \nexternal sector of the Indian economy focusing on exports, imports, international investment, \nforeign exchange reserves, movement of the currency against the US dollar, external debt, and the BoP situation. Where available, a comparison of some of these indicators with some peer countries is also made to present India’s external sector situation in a proper perspective. \ntrade helping India reap the Benefits of Globalised world\n11.4 In the present globalised and integrated world, trade is essential for developing countries \nto reap the benefit of increased globalisation of products and financial markets. It is well recognised that trade is not an end in itself but a means to balanced, equitable, and sustainable development. Conventional economic theories point towards potential gains that could emerge from openness to international trade and investment.\n11.5 Over time, the trade openness of countries across the globe has been increasing as measured \nby trade as a proportion of GDP. For the world as a whole, the share of trade as a percentage of \nworld GDP\n3 has been in the range of 50-60 per cent since 2003 and stood at 52 per cent in 2020, \naccording to the World Bank database. For India as well, the share of trade as a percentage of GDP has been steadily increasing, being above 40 per cent since 2005 (except 2020 being the pandemic year). The ratio stands at 46 per cent in 2021 and 50 per cent for H1 of 2022.\nGlobal Scenario\n11.6 Post Covid-19-induced disruptions, global trade prospects have improved in FY22. Global \ntrade exhibited resilience in the first half (H1) of 2022, notwithstanding the headwinds from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Robust merchandise imports – emerging primarily from Europe, the United States, and parts of the developing world supported the growth of merchandise trade in H12022. This partially reflected pent-up demand relating to the legacy of the pandemic-driven spending shift from services towards goods that were constrained earlier because of the supply bottlenecks. Other factors contributing to the trend were the appreciation of the dollar in the case of the United States, the relative dynamism of intra-regional trade in Europe, and favourable terms-of-trade effects in some large emerging economies due to elevated energy prices.\n4 The \nglobal trade volume grew by 4.8 per cent in H12022, on top of an impressive recovery of 9.7 per cent in 2021, as per the World Trade Organisation (WTO) statistics. The global merchandise trade in value terms rose year-on-year (YoY), by 22.2 per cent in 2021, reversing the deceleration observed in the previous three years. During the H1 of 2022, the trade-in value terms grew by 32 per cent compared to the corresponding period of 2019.\n5 \n11.7 However, the global trade outlook turned grimmer in the second half (H2) of 2022 on the \nback of a confluence of adverse factors including the increasing likelihood of a recession in the major economies and the tapering demand for consumer durables; aggressive monetary policy tightening by several central banks; disorderly financial conditions; continued supply-chain disruptions and elevated freight charges. The leading indicators of global trade viz., inventories \n3Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of GDP. \n4UNCTAD, Trade and Development Report 2022, Development prospects in a fractured world: Global disorder and regional responses, October \n2022.\n5WTO’s press release, International Trade Statistics, 5 October 2022.314\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nand new export orders seem to bear testimony to these adverse events. Trade growth is likely \nto slow in the closing months of 2022 and into 2023, according to the WTO Goods Trade Barometer\n6 released on 28 November 2022, as the global economy continues to be buffeted by \nstrong headwinds. The current reading of 96.2 is below both the baseline value for the index and the previous reading of 100.0, reflecting the slowdown in demand for traded goods.\n11.8 Thus, as regards the future trade projections, according to the WTO, world trade is expected \nto lose momentum in H2-2022 and remain subdued in 2023. The organisation forecasts global \ntrade to grow in 2023 by just 1 per cent, a sharp downward revision from the previous estimate of 3.4 per cent\n7. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with the forecast due \nto shifting monetary policy in advanced economies and the unpredictable nature of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in its Global Trade update of December 2022 has also noted that the ongoing trade slowdown is expected to worsen for 2023 and further that while the outlook for global trade remains uncertain, negative factors appear to outweigh positive trends.\nfigure xI.1: Growth in Global Merchandise trade: actual and forecast\n19.5 19.017.622.2\n3.4\n0.5\n-5.69.7\n3.51.03.0\n3.4\n-10-50510152025\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023Value US$ trillion / Volume percent change (Y -o-Y)\nValue (US$ trillion) Volume Volume Forecast (Oct 2022) Volume Forecast (April 2022)\nSource: WTO\nIndia’s growing and diversifying trade\n11.9 International trade has been an important pillar of the resilience of India’s external sector. \nTrade as a percentage of GDP for India was in the range of 12-15 per cent in the 1980s; 16-25 \nper cent in the 1990s and 25-50 per cent in the 2000s.

Merchandise exports were US$ 332.8 billion over April-December 2022 against US$ 305.0 billion during the period April-December 2021. Non-petroleum and non-gems & jewellery exports in April-December 2022 were US$ 233.5 billion, as compared to US$ 230.0 billion in April-December 2021. Petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) exports constituted about 21.1 per cent and non-POL exports were 78.9 per cent of total exports during FY23 (until December 2022). Owing to the rise in global crude oil prices, petroleum products continued to be the most exported commodity in FY22 and April-December, 2022, followed by gems and jewellery, organic & inorganic chemicals, and drugs & pharmaceuticals (Tables 6.3A & B of Statistical Appendix).\nfigure xI.3: India’s Merchandise Exports5\n7\n5\n8\n13\n16\n18\n21\n27\n24\n1947\n67\n70\n82\n83\n87\n89\n96\n94\n87\n82\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3\n2020 -21 2021 -22 2022 -23 (P)POL Exports Non POL ExportsUS$ Billion\nSource: Department of Commerce   Note: P: Provisional\nBright spots in India’s trade performance\n11.11 Significant strides in exports were registered in drugs and pharmaceutical, electronic \ngoods, engineering goods and organic and inorganic chemicals sectors in FY22. These sectors have sustained their growth momentum despite the global headwinds in H1FY23. India’s pharma exports grew despite Covid impacted disruptions in supply chain increasing significantly from US$ 15.4 billion in FY15 to US$ 24.6 billion in FY22 and stood at US$ 18.8 billion during April-December 2022, registering a positive growth of 3.6 per cent over April- December 2021. The high growth in export was on account of the stocking of inventories of medicines by countries all over the world, and increased demand for vaccines and medicines related to the Covid-19 pandemic which India was in a position to provide. India has also been seeing consistent growth in exports of electronic goods. Electronic goods exports which remained below US$ 10 billion till FY19, have shown an increase of 51.6 per cent from US$ 11.0 billion during April-December 317\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\n2021 to US$ 16.7 billion during April-December. 2022.

Organic and inorganic chemicals exports have increased significantly in FY22 and were USD 23.0 billion during April-December 2022 registering a growth of 6.5 per cent over the same period last year.\n11.12 As the pandemic ebbed, India witnessed a revival in domestic demand resulting in strong \nimport growth. Merchandise imports for the period April-December 2022 were US$ 551.7 \nbillion as against US$ 441.5 billion during the period April-December 2021. Among major import commodities, petroleum crude & products imports increased by 45.6 per cent to US$ 163.9 billion in April-December 2022 compared to US$ 112.6 billion in April-December 2021 and continue to be the highest imported commodity.\n11.13 Energy demand may be pushing India’s imports for fuel including coal and Petroleum, Oil \n& Lubricants (POL), whose share rose to 37.1 per cent in total imports in April-December 2022 \nagainst 30.4 per cent in the corresponding period last year.

The Netherlands has displaced China from the 3rd spot as India\'s exporting \npartner. India has diversified its export destinations over time. For example, the share of South Africa in total exports has risen from 1.2 per cent in FY19 to 2.0 per cent in FY23 (April to November). Over the same period, the share of Brazil has increased from 1.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent and that of Saudi Arabia from 1.7 per cent to 2.3 per cent. As regards imports, China, UAE, USA, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have a joint share of 40 per cent of the total imports of India. However, the share of China declined to 13.8 per cent during April-November 2022 from 15.5 per cent a year ago. Similarly, the share of the USA declined to 6.9 per cent in April-November 2022 from 7.2 per cent a year ago (Refer to Table 6.4 in Statistical Appendix).\nTrade in Services\n11.16 India maintained its dominance in the world services trade in FY22.  Despite pandemic-\ninduced global restrictions and weak tourism revenues, India’s services exports stood at US$ 254.5 billion in FY22 recording a growth of 23.5 per cent over FY21 and registered a growth of 32.7 per cent in April-September 2022 over the same period of FY22. Software and business services together constitute more than 60 per cent of India’s total services exports and exhibited strong growth during Q2FY23. While strong revenues in major information technology (IT) companies from various segments such as retail and consumer business; communications and media; healthcare; and banking, financial and insurance services drove the growth in software exports, a significant pick-up in engineering, and research and development related services boosted the growth in business services exports during the quarter. \n11.17 Services imports rose by 25.1 per cent between FY22 and FY21 to reach US$ 147.0 billion \nand have registered growth of 36.7 per cent in April-September 2022 over the same period of \nFY22. The increase in services imports is mainly on account of payments for transport services, travel and other business services. Following the resumption of global activity, shortages of 319\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\nshipping vessels and high transportation costs resulted in a spike in transport payments.

Since India offers low-cost knowledge-based services, the demand for them has not fallen even amid a global economic slowdown and a negative outlook for the near future. The estimated value of services export for April-December 2022 is US$ 235.8 billion as against a value of US$ 184.7 billion in April- December 2021. The estimated value of services imports for April- December 2022 is US$ 135.0 billion compared to US$ 105.5 billion in the corresponding period last year.  Supported by the services sector, India\'s overall exports (Merchandise and Services combined) in April-December 2022 are estimated to be US$ 568.6 billion, exhibiting a positive growth of 16.1 per cent over the same period last year. Overall imports in April-December 2022 are estimated to be US$ 686.7 billion, displaying a positive growth of 25.6 per cent over the same period last year.\nforeign t rade policy\n11.19 India’s Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) has, conventionally, been formulated for five years \nat a time. The focus of the FTP has been to provide a framework of rules and procedures for exports and imports and a set of incentives for promoting exports. The latest FTP for 2015- 2020 is in vogue at present. To provide policy stability during the pandemic period, the five-year FTP 2015-20 was extended from 2020 to 2022. The policy has been further extended till March 2023 on account of volatile global economic and geopolitical situations and currency fluctuations. During this period, the Government has been taking significant measures and consistently looking into opportunities to diversify the exports both in terms of products as well as potential markets. The Government is actively working on facilitating trade agreements and launching schemes in consultation with various stakeholders. In the year 2022, India signed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with UAE and with Australia. This aims to provide greater market access with a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods and services and make the exporters competitive. The Export Preparedness Index\n8 has also been introduced to evaluate \nStates’ potentials and capacities. It will guide all stakeholders towards strengthening the export ecosystem at both the national and sub-national levels. \nInternational trade Settlement in Indian rupees\n11.20 In July 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular permitting an additional \narrangement for invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports/imports in Indian Rupees (INR) to promote the growth of global trade with emphasis on exports from India and to support the increasing interest in the global trading community in INR as an international currency. The framework involves invoicing of exports and imports in INR, market-determined exchange rates between the currencies of the trading partner countries, and settlement through special Rupee V ostro\n9 accounts opened with authorised dealer banks in India.\n11.21 Under this arrangement for settlement, (a) Indian importers undertaking imports through \n8NITI Aayog in partnership with the Institute of Competitiveness has prepared an Export Preparedness Index to identify challenges and oppor -\ntunities; enhance the effectiveness of government policies; and encourage a facilitative regulatory framework. The structure of the EPI includes \n4 pillars –Policy; Business Ecosystem; Export Ecosystem; Export Performance – and 11 sub-pillars –Export Promotion Policy; Institutional Framework; Business Environment; Infrastructure; Transport Connectivity; Access to Finance; Export Infrastructure; Trade Support; R&D Infrastructure; Export Diversification; and Growth Orientation.\n9A V ostro account is an account that a domestic bank holds for a foreign bank in the domestic bank’s currency, i.e., Rupee. Such accounts enable \ndomestic banks to provide international banking services to their clients who have global banking needs.321\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\nthis mechanism shall make payment in INR which shall be credited into the Special V ostro \naccount of the correspondent bank of the partner country, against the invoices for the supply of goods or services from the overseas seller /supplier, while (b) Indian exporters, undertaking exports of goods and services through this mechanism, shall be paid the export proceeds in INR from the balances in the designated Special V ostro account of the correspondent bank of the partner country.\n11.22 The above-mentioned framework for international settlement in INR acquires significance \nagainst the backdrop of the US Fed aggressively hiking the policy rates and its hawkish stand, \nthe consequent rallying of the US dollar to multi-decade high levels, and concomitant weakening of currencies of various EMEs including the INR. The framework could largely reduce the net demand for foreign exchange, the US dollar in particular, for the settlement of current account-related trade flows. Further, the use of INR in cross-border trade is expected to mitigate currency risk for Indian businesses. Protection from currency volatility not only reduces the cost of doing business but also enables better business growth, improving the chances for Indian businesses to grow globally. It also reduces the need for holding foreign exchange reserves and dependence on foreign currency, making Indian economy less vulnerable to external shocks.\n10 Further, it \ncould assist Indian exporters in getting advance payments in INR from overseas clients and in the longer term promote INR as an international currency once the rupee settlement mechanism gains traction. One of the prerequisites for the emergence of an international currency is that the said currency needs to be increasingly used for trade invoicing. In terms of foreign exchange market turnover (daily averages), as per the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey 2022, the US dollar is the dominant vehicle currency accounting for 88 per cent of the global forex turnover. The INR accounted for 1.6 per cent. If the INR turnover rises to equal the share of non-US, non-Euro currencies in global forex turnover of 4 per cent, INR could be regarded as an international currency, reflecting India’s position in the global economy.\n11\nInitiatives to enhance trade \n11.23 The commendable performance of India’s exports, standing at US$ 422.0 billion in FY22, \nexceeding the target of US$ 400 billion, has been the culmination of efforts from all quarters and across stakeholders. Some of the factors leading to the achievement of this target were putting in place of targets by the Government, including the setting of specific targets - country-wise, product-wise, and Export Promotion Council-wise; monitoring of the targets and course correction where required. The export growth was driven by an increase in demand for products like petroleum, cotton yarn, textiles, chemicals, and engineering goods. India was able to leverage the gap in the supply of certain products in the wake of the pandemic-related disruptions and meet the global demand. Exports were also helped by favourable global commodity prices. Some of the specific schemes of the Government which have and are facilitating and encouraging exports are as follows.\n11.24 focus on agricultural products: India’s agricultural exports achieved the highest ever \nexport in FY22 reaching US$ 37.8 billion and it continued to perform well in FY23 with exports \n10Keynote address delivered by Shri T Rabi Sankar, Deputy Governor, RBI at the Annual Day event of the Foreign Exchange Dealers Associa-\ntion of India (FEDAI) on 20 October 2022 in Mumbai.\n11Patra, M. D (2022): India@75, RBI Bulletin, August, pp 13-34.322\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nof US$ 26.8 billion during April- November 2022 backed by an effective agriculture export policy. \nPro-active support of export promotion agencies including Export Inspection Council, Plantation Boards, and Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), and export facilitating measures like online issuance of certificates required for exports, aided growth of agricultural exports. Regular promotions were organised for agricultural products through participation in trade fairs and special events in association with the Indian Missions.\nTo initiate agriculture exports from UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, APEDA has linked \nKashmir valley start-ups, new entrepreneurs, Farmer Producer Organisations/farmer groups, and exporters of the region with importers. Regular shipments of high-value Kashmir Saffron (GI) are taking place to destinations including the Middle East, EU, and North America. \n11.25 Interest Equalisation Scheme: This Scheme was formulated to give benefit in the \ninterest rates being charged by the banks to the exporters on their pre- and post-shipment rupee \nexport credits.  While extending the scheme, from 1 October 2021 onwards, subvention rates have also been reduced. Henceforth, reduced revised rates of 3 per cent (erstwhile 5 per cent) subvention to MSME manufacturing exporters and 2 per cent (erstwhile 3 per cent) applies to merchant and other manufacturer exporters exporting along 410 (erstwhile 416) HS lines. \n11.26 remission of duties and taxes on Exported products (rodtEp) scheme: The scheme \nseeks remission of Central, State and Local duties/taxes/levies at different stages at the Central, \nState, and local level, which are incurred in the process of manufacturing and distribution of exported products, but are currently not being refunded under any other duty remission scheme.\n11.27 Export credit Guarantee: The Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) supports \nIndian exporters and banks by providing export credit insurance services. ECGC provides insurance \ncover on the export consignment to protect exporters from the consequences of the payment risks. It also provides Export Credit Insurance to Banks (ECIB) to protect the Banks from losses on account of export credit given to exporters due to the risks of insolvency and/or protracted default of the exporter borrower. The ECGC has launched a new scheme in  July 2022, under its ECIB products. Under this scheme the insurance cover to banks providing pre-shipment and post-shipment finance has been enhanced to 90 per cent from an average coverage of 70 per cent for accounts with an export working capital limit of up to X20 crore to support small exporters. \n11.28 Krishi udan Scheme: Krishi Udan Scheme was launched in August 2020 on international \nand national routes to assist farmers in transporting agricultural products so that it improves \ntheir value realisation. Krishi Udan 2.0 was launched in October 2021 enhancing the existing provisions, mainly focusing on transporting perishable food products from the hilly areas, North-Eastern states, and tribal areas. For facilitating and incentivising the movement of agricultural produce by air transportation, the Airports Authority of India provides a full waiver of Landing, Parking charges, Terminal Navigational Landing Charges and Route Navigation Facility Charges for Indian freighters and Passenger-to-Cargo Aircraft primarily around 25 airports focusing on North Eastern, Hilly and Tribal region and 28 airports in other regions/areas. Further, five more airports have been included under the Scheme, making it 58 airports.\n11.29   t rade Infrastructure for Export Scheme: The Government has been implementing \nthe Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme since FY18 to assist Central and State Government 323\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\nAgencies in the creation of appropriate infrastructure for the growth of exports from the \nStates. The Scheme provides financial assistance in the form of grant-in-aid to Central/State Government owned agencies for setting up or for up-gradation of export infrastructure as per the guidelines of the Scheme. \n11.30 districts as Export hubs – One District One Product Initiative:  The Districts as Export \nHubs-ODOP initiative is aimed at targeting export promotion, manufacturing, and employment \ngeneration at the grassroots level, making the States and Districts meaningful stakeholders and active participants in making India an export powerhouse thereby contributing to the AatmNirbhar mission and achieving the vision of Make in India for the world and being V ocal for Local. The initiative is also aimed at fostering balanced regional development across all districts of the country. It seeks to select, brand, and promote products/services from each district of the country for enabling holistic socioeconomic growth across all regions, attract investment in the district to boost manufacturing and exports. A growing emphasis on exports by focusing on districts as potential export hubs is also likely to integrate India more closely with the global value chain and propel India to be a significant exporter by leveraging the diversity and competitiveness in agriculture, marine, textile, pharmaceutical, chemicals and many engineering products. \nIndia’s Global trade Engagements\n11.31 This era of globalisation has been accompanied by a proliferation of trade agreements \nand the emergence of competing trade blocs. These trends are affecting every business, every industry, and every country so that keeping up with these changes has become a challenging task for policymakers around the globe. Governments have been pursuing international trade cooperation largely driven by diverse external and internal political economy considerations such as promoting peace and stability, increasing market size and most importantly, insuring themselves against unfavourable trade policies of other countries.\n11.32 India has always stood for an open, equitable, predictable, non-discriminatory, and rule-\nbased international trading system. India considers Regional Trading Arrangements (RTAs) as \n‘building blocks’ towards the overall objective of trade liberalisation and as complementing the multilateral trading system. Recognising that RTAs would continue to feature permanently in world trade, India has engaged with its trading partners/blocs with the intention of expanding its export market since the early part of the previous decade and began concluding, in principle agreements to move, in some cases, towards Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreements (CECA) which covers FTA in goods, services, investment and identifies areas of economic cooperation. \n11.33 The economic rationale for FTAs was the diversification and expansion of India’s exports to its \ntrading partners, providing a level playing field vis-à-vis the competing countries having preferential \naccess in our trading partners, as well as gain easier access to raw materials and intermediate products, at lower costs, for stimulating value-added domestic manufacturing. In the case of the India-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), India-Korea, and India-Japan Agreements, this was also part of a geopolitical strategy that dovetailed well into India’s “Look East Policy.” \n11.34 India has so far concluded 13 FTAs and 6 Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). The \nmost recent in the list are the India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement \n(CEPA) which was signed on 18 February 2022 and officially entered into force on 1 May 324\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n2022 and the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (Ind-Aus ECTA), \nwhich was signed on 2 April 2022 and entered into force on 29 December 2022. Further, India is presently engaged in FTA negotiations with some of its trading partners, notable among these FTAs are – (i) India-UK FTA, (ii) India-Canada CEPA/ Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA), (iii) India-EU FTA.  Moreover, India has also initiated action to review some of the existing FTAs, namely, India-Singapore CECA, India-South Korea CEPA, and India-ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement and initiated discussions on scoping for the CECA with Australia, as envisaged under Ind-Aus ECTA.\n12 Box XI.1 discusses the rise in the number of FTAs being \nentered into worldwide and various factors that determine their usefulness to a trading partner.\nBox xI.1:  free trade agreements\nFTAs or RTAs in terms of the WTO rules13, are economic instruments available to a country for \nleveraging its competencies in trade and investment.  As of June 2016, all WTO members now have \nat least one RTA in force. There has been a substantial rise in the number of trade agreements with \n355 notifications of RTAs having been made to the WTO (As of 1 December 2022– Source: WTO website). Many WTO members continue to be involved in negotiations to create new RTAs, which \nare mostly bilateral. However, a recent development has been negotiations and new agreements \namong more than two WTO members, such as:\n• Pacific Alliance between Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru (Signed on 10 February 2014; \nentered into force on 1 May 2016);\n• Tripartite Agreement, linking parties to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the \nEast African Community and the Southern African Development Community (Launched on 10 \nJune 2015 and entered into force at different dates by different members);\n• Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (Signed on 8 March 2018; entered into force on 31 October 2018);\n• African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) (Signed on 21 March 2018 and entered into force \nat different dates by different members); and\n• Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (RCEP) between the ASEAN members and six other WTO members (Signed on 15 November 2020; entered into force on 1 January 2022).\nThe limited progress in the multilateral trade negotiations at the WTO is one of the reasons responsible for the increase in FTAs. FTAs are viewed favourably by trading countries in comparison \nto multilateral negotiation at the WTO forum as they are easy to negotiate and provide flexibility to \nfactor in geopolitical considerations.\nThe purpose of RTAs is to lower tariffs on goods and services and increase cooperation between \ntrading partners with the aim of increasing trade, lower prices for consumers, and provide enhanced \nexport opportunities for producers. RTAs can also have a larger impact on the economy. For instance, Bailé et al. (2019) found that FTAs are positively correlated with direct domestic value-added exports, \nas well as forward and backward participation in global value chains.\n12 For an understanding of various types of trade agreements that India has entered into, may refer to: https://www.tpci.in/research_report/types-\nof-trade-agreements/.\n13RTAs, as per WTO rules, are any reciprocal trade agreement between two or more partners, not necessarily belonging to the same region.325\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\nAccording to the conventional gravity model, developed by Tinbergen (1962), bilateral trade \nbetween two nations is proportional to their respective sizes, measured by their GDPs and inversely \nproportional to the geographic distance, a proxy for transportation cost. Over time, more variables, \nsuch as exchange rates, income levels and shifting demand patterns, have been added to the standard gravity model to test their relevance in influencing trade (Osabuohien et al., 2019).\nWhile an FTA provides the enabling environment for enhancing trade by reducing tariff and non-\ntariff barriers (NTBs), the trade growth of a country depends on many factors, such as:\n(a) Specific features of the FTA such as the extent of tariff relaxations given vis-à-vis the Most \nFavoured Nation (MFN) tariffs\n14, on which products they are given and how the relaxation is \nstaggered, i.e., is it over a long time or short time that the relaxations are agreed to be rolled out.15  \n(b) The extent of concessions in terms of Rules of Origin (RoO)16 and removal/easing of NTBs. \nWhile tariff barriers are agreed to be reduced in an FTA, NTBs, such as sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures, technical barriers to trade, contingent trade-protective measures etc., may lower the \nutilisation of the FTAs by traders.\n(c) The capacity of an economy to increase the supply of products/services for which the FTA \nhas provided an enhanced export venue. This ‘supply-response’ is determined by a wide range \nof factors which largely fall outside the ambit of an FTA. They include various policies on production aspects, a country’s physical and institutional infrastructure, and other elements determining the short-term flexibility of an economy. In other words, the supply-response is \ngoverned by the potential for trade creation wherein a member of an FTA, having a comparative \nadvantage in producing a product, is now able to sell it to its FTA partners because trade barriers \nhave been removed (Viner, 1950). \n(d) The effect of the FTA would also depend on income growth in the importing markets and the \nprice competitiveness of exports of a partner country in a trade agreement so as to be able to take advantage of the agreement.\nFurther, not all trade may happen through the FTA route, especially if the RoO are cumbersome or \ngoods are already trading at MFN zero duty. In order to take advantage of the FTAs, these must be \naggressively utilised by the traders and service providers. Thus, it may not happen that there will be a sudden or significant increase in trade after an FTA is signed between two or more countries. The \ntrade balance would shift only gradually and may also turn out to not be in favour of each partner, \ndepending on a host of factors, some of which are listed above. \nrEfErEncES• Baier, S.L., Y .V .

Zylkin. 2019. “On the Widely Differing Effects of Free Trade \nAgreements: Lessons from Twenty Years of Trade Integration,” Journal of International Economics 116:206–226.\n14 The MFN clause refers to a special trading status given by one country to another that gets applied to all the other members of the WTO. \n15 FTAs generally have phase-in periods in which existing trade barriers are phased out over time. This is generally done so that producers in the \nimporting country can adjust to import competition. This typically occurs over 10 to 15 years after the ratification of the FTA.\n16Rules of origin are the criteria needed to determine the national source of a product. Their importance is derived from the fact that duties and \nrestrictions in several cases depend upon the source of imports.326\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n• Osabuohien, E. S., Efobi, U.

India’s current account \nbalance (CAB) recorded a deficit of US$ 36.4 billion (4.4 per cent of GDP) in Q2FY23 in contrast to a deficit of US$ 9.7 billion (1.3 per cent of GDP) during the corresponding period of the previous year. The widening of the current account deficit (CAD) in the second quarter of FY23 was mainly on account of a higher merchandise trade deficit of US$ 83.5 billion and an increase in net investment income outgo. For the period April- September 2022 (H1FY23), India recorded a CAD of 3.3 per cent of GDP on the back of an increase in the merchandise trade deficit, as compared with 0.2 per cent in H1FY22. However, a comparison with the position of the CAB for selected countries shows that India’s CAD is modest and within manageable limits.\nxI.7: current account Balance (caB): Magnitude and composition\n-6-4-20246\n-40-30-20-100102030\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2\n2020-21 2021-22 2022-23\n(P)\nPer cent of GDP  US$ Billion  CAB CAB to GDP ratio (RHS)\n-100-80-60-40-20020406080\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2\n2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 (P)US$ Billion Net Merch.

Furthermore, with more repayments in comparison to fresh disbursals, external commercial borrowings (ECBs) to India recorded net outflows of US$ 3.0 billion in H1FY23 as against net inflows of US$ 5.0 billion a year ago.330\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nBalance of payments and foreign Exchange reserves\n11.42 Overall, the adverse global economic situation placed India’s BoP under pressure in 2022. \nWhile the impact of a sharp rise in oil prices was discernible in the widening of the CAD, policy \ntightening by the US Fed and the strengthening of the US dollar led to FPI outflows. As a result, as the net financial inflows fell short of the CAD, there was a depletion of foreign exchange reserves on a BoP basis to the tune of US$ 25.8 billion in H1FY23 in contrast to an accretion of US$ 63.1 billion in H1FY22.  But huge valuation losses (US$ 48.9 billion) contributed to the net depletion of US$ 74.6 billion of reserves in nominal terms during the period.\n11.43 India’s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 532.7 billion as of end-September 2022, \ncovering 8.8 months of imports. The reserves augmented to US$ 562.7 billion as of end-\nDecember 2022 covering 9.3 months of imports. As of end-November 2022, India was the sixth largest foreign exchange reserves holder in the world according to data compiled by the IMF. As seen from the graph, the import coverage of foreign currency reserves has declined since the pre-pandemic levels in most emerging market economies; however, that of India has increased from 95% in Q4 2019 to 96.5% in Q3 2022.

Are there \nsome international benchmarks or thumb rules which can serve as a guide? What are the factors \nwhich a country should consider while determining its own threshold of “adequacy”? How best to \nensure the liquidity of such reserves as against mere availability? This box attempts to answer these questions by drawing from the relevant literature and present an academic perspective.\nFER is required for various purposes, such as to maintain the exchange rate within a certain range, \nor to maintain a certain level of exchange rate if the country follows a fixed exchange rate system; \nmaintain liquidity and allow time to absorb shocks in situations where access to borrowing is curtailed or very costly. The optimal level of reserves empowers the government to maximise the welfare of \nthe representative consumer, given the constraint of sudden stops in terms of debt rollover crisis. The drivers behind the accumulation of reserves have evolved over the years: initially for precautionary \npurposes until the early 2000s, followed by goals of monetary and exchange rate policies (Arslan Yavuz, et al 2019). Accordingly, the FERs of several countries have witnessed a rising trend, more so \nsince the global financial crisis of 2008.\ntable: total foreign exchange reserves excluding gold (in uS$ bn)\n2005 2008 2019 2020 2021nov-\n2022%change:  \n2021 over \n2008\nRussian Federation 175.9 411.8 443.9 457.0 497.6 567.3 20.8\nIndia 131.9 247.4 432.4 549.1 594.4 555.3 140.3\nBrazil 53.3 192.8 353.6 351.5 354.6 331.5 83.9\nUnited States 54.1 66.6 118.4 133.9 240.2 237.8 260.7\nUnited Kingdom 54.0 56.1 158.4 161.2 176.0 204.1 213.7\nIndonesia 33.1 49.6 125.3 131.1 140.3 134.0 182.9\nSouth Africa 18.6 30.6 48.9 47.4 50.3 60.0 64.4\nAustralia 41.9 30.7 55.6 39.2 53.8 57.9 75.2\nWorld 4395.0 7418.2 12195.3 13122.5 13944.7 11598.6*  88.0\nSource: International Financial Statistics, IMF\n*Figure as of Sept 2022\nThis brings in the debate on adequacy of reserves. Conventionally, there are three measures of \nadequacy of reserves, viz. ratios of reserves to imports, to monetary aggregates, and measures of external debt (IMF, 2000). According to the traditional approach to determining the adequacy of \nreserves, the simple rule of thumb is three months of imports or full cover of short-term debt. As \nregards the former, there is little empirical support for whether the adequate coverage should be three  \nmonths, as opposed to say two or six (IMF, 2011). The latter derives from the Guidotti–Greenspan-IMF rule which states that a country\'s reserves should equal short-term external debt (one-year or less maturity), suggesting a ratio of reserves-to-short term debt of one. The rationale is that countries332\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nshould have enough reserves to cope with the withdrawal of short-term foreign capital. Then there \nare also money-based indicators of reserves which provide a measure of the potential for resident-\nbased capital flight from the currency. The indicators used are the ratio of reserves to broad money or \nthe ratio of reserves to base money which help in assessing reserve adequacy under fixed exchange rate regimes. Each of these indicators may, in themselves, not be adequate to assess the requirements \nof FERs for an economy and different measures may typically be used for different purposes.\nThe IMF (SM/00/65, 3/23/2000), noted the importance of short-term debt as a source of risk but cautioned \nagainst excessive reliance on a single indicator and pointed to the need to consider various potential \nsources of short-term demand for reserves. Further, IMF (SM/01/311, 10/16/2001) has noted the need \nto complement indicator-based analyses with stress-testing of the BoP. In addition, there are customised \nrisk-based broader-based metrics tailor-made to capture sources of risk emanating from external liabilities (debt and equity) as well as current account variables (export earnings) and some measure of potential \ncapital flight (broad money) (IMF, 2011).  Adequacy should be considered against total resources available \nto meet shocks, a broader concept than the BoP-determined definition of reserve assets.\nWhile reserves are imperative in both preventing crises situations and mitigating their impact, there \nis a cost involved in holding them and they are subject to diminishing returns. The costs borne by an \neconomy for holding FER include the opportunity cost, in terms of the difference between domestic and foreign borrowing rates and loss due to the value reduction in the denominated FER. Rodrik \n(2006) examines the social cost of FERs and finds that the income loss to most developing countries \namounts to close to one per cent of GDP.\nFukuda and Kon (2010) evaluate the macroeconomic impact of reserve accumulation and find evidence \nthat an increase in FERs raises external debt outstanding but shortens debt maturity. Further, in the long-\nrun, consumption declines, and exports, are promoted by encouraging a switch from the non-tradable \nsector to the tradable sector through higher investment and growth. Further, FERs could be inflationary through exchange rate effects (Lin, et al 2009) and moral hazard and incentive effects (Chitu, 2016). \nTherefore, an economy should organise its reserves FER, in terms of the optimal size and currency \ncomposition, considering the benefits, costs, and impacts of holding them. Co-movement of the \ndomestic currency with key currencies and the currency invoicing of trade (Ito, 2019); trade flows (trade invoicing), financial flows (share of debt service payments in a currency), and currency pegs \n(Eichengreen, 2000) are the dominant factors influencing the currency composition of FERs.  Further, \ndrawing from the field of finance, the Value at Risk (VaR) approach has also been employed to arrive at the optimal foreign exchange portfolio (Hung et al. (2008).   \nAs briefly reviewed above, the rich literature on reserve adequacy presents very useful background \ninformation and empirical analysis for policy choices and likely outcomes.\nrEfErEncES\n• Arslan, Yavuz and Cantú, Carlos (2019), “The size of foreign exchange reserves”, BIS Papers \nNo 104.\n• Chiou, J-S., Hung, J-C, and Hseu, M-M.

On a financial year \nbasis, i.e., from April to December 2022, the INR has depreciated against US$ by 8.3 per cent.20 Over \nthe same period, the US dollar has appreciated by 4.4 per cent in terms of the US dollar index.21 This \nholds even on a calendar year basis, i.e., from January to December 2022, the INR has depreciated by 10.8 per cent whereas the US dollar has appreciated by 6.4 per cent. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate  (NEER) of the US dollar (27 economies)  appreciated by 7.8  per cent in  the calendar year 2022, up to December, while the NEER of India (64 economies) depreciated by 4.8 per cent. In other words, it is not that the INR has weakened, but it is the US dollar that has strengthened. No matter how many tweets are written against that observation, it is a fact. Several other currencies depreciated even more value against the US dollar than the INR (Refer Figure I.12 of Chapter I). Thus, the external value of INR vis-à-vis the US dollar has seen very orderly movements during the year since the onset of the current geopolitical crisis.  \n11.45  Further, the INR appreciated against select major currencies barring the US dollar.  The \naverage exchange rate of INR against the Pound Sterling appreciated by 6.7 per cent in April \n-December 2022 over April - December 2021. This rate of appreciation was 14.5 per cent with respect to the Japanese Yen and 6.4 per cent against the Euro.\n20 Change in Monthly average exchange rate in December 2022 over April 2022.\n21The U.S. dollar index (US$X) is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies.

On a financial year basis, i.e., between April 2022 and December 2022, the INR depreciated 3.4 per cent and 4.0 per cent measured in terms of 6-currency and 40-currency trade-weighted indices, respectively. Thus, even in real terms, the INR witnessed modest depreciation in the face of global spill overs.\n11.47 In terms of the 6-currency NEER (trade-weighted), the rupee depreciated by 4.4 per cent \nin December 2022 over April 2022. Similarly, the rupee depreciated by 4.7 per cent in terms of \n40-currency NEER\n22  (trade-weighted) in December 2022 over April 2022.\nxI.17: Movement of Index of 6-currency and 40-currency nEEr and rEEr  \n(trade-based weight) (the base Year 2015-16 = 100)\n98100102104106\n8283848586878889\nMar 2022\nApr 2022\nMay 2022\nJun 2022\nJul 2022\nAug 2022\nSep 2022\nOct 2022\nNov 2022\nDec 2022Index6-Currency                       \nNEER REER (RHS)\n98100102104106\n8688909294\nMar 2022\nApr 2022\nMay 2022\nJun 2022\nJul 2022\nAug 2022\nSep 2022\nOct 2022\nNov 2022\nDec 2022Index40 Currency \nNEER REER (RHS)a. 6- currency trade-Based b. 40- currency trade Based\nSource: RBI\n22 The indices NEER and REER are used as indicators of external competitiveness.

The REER, defined as a weighted average of nomi-nal exchange rates adjusted for relative price differential between the domestic and foreign countries, relates to the PPP  hypothesis.335\nExternal Sector: Watchful and Hopeful\nInternational Investment position: a reflection of India\'s financial \nSoundness\n11.48 The international investment position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point \nin time the value and composition of (a) financial assets of residents of an economy that are \nclaims on non-residents and gold bullion held as reserve assets, and (b) liabilities of residents of an economy to non-residents. The difference between an economy’s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.\n23 The Net IIP position \ndetermines whether a country is a net creditor or debtor nation by measuring the difference in its external assets and liabilities. These statistics serve as an indicator of a country’s financial condition and soundness. The Net IIP, along with the BoP transactions, reflects the domestic economy’s set of international accounts.\n11.49 For India, as of end-September 2022, Indian residents’ overseas financial assets at US$ \n847.5 billion were lower by US$ 73.0 billion or 7.9 per cent compared to the level as of end-\nMarch 2022, mainly due to the reduction in reserve assets even as trade credit and overseas direct investment recorded an increase. Reserve assets at US$ 532.7 billion, accounting for around 62.9 per cent of India’s international financial assets fell by 12.3 per cent over the same period. \n11.50 International liabilities at US$ 1,237.1 billion as of end-September 2022 were lower by \nUS$ 41.6 billion (3.2 per cent) as compared to the level as of end-March 2022. This fall was \nattributed primarily to direct investment (net) outflows, while variations in the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis other currencies also had an impact on the change in liabilities when valued in US$ terms. The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities was 50 per cent as of end-September 2022. \n11.51 Thus, the net claims of non-residents on India, valued at US$ 389.6 billion as of end-\nSeptember 2022, increased by US$ 31.4 billion over the level as of end-March 2022. India’s \ninternational financial assets covered 68.5 per cent of international financial liabilities as of end-September 2022.\nxI.18: India’s net International Investment position in end-September 2022\n-388 -390\n-16.4-11.5\n-18-16-14-12-10-8-6-4-20\n-500-450-400-350-300-250-200-150-100-500\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Sept 2022\n(P)\nPer cent of GDPUS$ BillionNet IIP Net IIP to GDP- RHS\n59.560.259.562.171.172.0\n68.5\n4045505560657075\n2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 SEPT 2022 \n(P)a. net IIp  and as percentage to Gdp b. asset liabilities ratio (in per cent\nSource: RBI; P: Provisional\n23 IMF, Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6),336\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nSafe and Sound External debt Situation\n11.52 India’s external debt, at US$ 610.5 billion as of end-September 2022, grew by 1.3 per \ncent (US$ 7.6 billion) over US$ 602.9 billion as of end-September 2021. However, external debt \nas a ratio to GDP fell to 19.2 per cent as of end-September 2022 from 20.3 per cent a year ago. The literature documents that the optimal threshold for India’s external debt is around 23-24 per cent of GDP.\n24 Thus, India has the potential growth positive space as far as the external debt \nlevel is concerned. While testifying to the prudent management of India’s external debt, this contrasts with the external debt distress unfolding in many peer countries, post-covid.  \n11.53 The long-term debt was lower at US$ 478.7 billion as of end-September 2022 than \nUS$ 498.1 billion a year ago with the share of long-term debt falling to 78.4 per cent from \n82.8 per cent during the same period. On the other hand, the short-term debt at US$ 131.7 billion as of end-September 2022 was higher than US$ 104.8 billion as of end-September 2021. Accordingly, the share of short-term debt in total debt went up to 21.6 per cent from 17.4 per cent. In this context, it needs to be noted that about 97 per cent of short-term debt is in the form of trade credit to finance imports and hence the rise in short-term debt is stability-friendly. Further, while a major part of India’s external debt is denominated in the US dollar (55.5 per cent as at-September 2002), the Indian rupee-denominated component (30.2 per cent) occupies the second largest position, insulating the external debt from foreign currency risk, thereby augmenting stability friendly characteristics of the external debt.  \n11.54 As of end-September 2022, Sovereign External Debt (SED) amounted to US$ 124.5 \nbillion, decreasing by 5.7 per cent over the level a year ago. Non-SED, estimated at US$ 486.0 \nbillion as of end-September 2022, posted a growth of 3.2 per cent over the level a year ago. Deposit-taking Corporations (except the Central Bank) and non-financial corporations accounted for the bulk of non-SED. \n11.55 The Ministry of Finance’s “India’s External Debt: A Status Report 2019-20”, provides \ndetails of the evolution of India’s external debt.\n25 A discernible trend in the rise in external debt \nof the non-sovereign sector over the SED is seen since FY99. Accordingly, typically, in a normal \nyear, it is the relative movements in non-SED that influences the dynamics of the country’s external debt. In the pandemic year of FY21, it was the growth in SED that accounted for a larger share of the overall growth of foreign debt due to Covid-19 loans from multilateral institutions.  As the pandemic receded and normalcy was restored with the revival of the economy, the usual dynamics of India’s external debt returned as the growth in non-SED constituted as much as 4.7 percentage points out of the overall external debt growth of 8.0 per cent at end-March 2022. However, the quarter ending September 2022, yet again witnessed deviation from the usual dynamics. It was the relative growth in SED (akin to the pandemic year) that influenced the overall external debt dynamics on the back decline in external assistance as well as other government debt which includes FPI investment in G-Sec and SDR. Out of the overall decline in India’s external debt by 0.4 per cent, the fall in the SED was 0.5 per cent, while the rise in non-SED was 0.2 per cent.    \n24 Gopinath, Tulasi and Rajeshwar.

External debt as a \nratio to GDP at 19.2 per cent as of end-September 2022 was lower than 19.9 per cent as of end-\nMarch 2022. The debt service ratio (principal repayments plus interest payments) stood at 5.0 per cent vis-à-vis 5.2 per cent as of end-March 2022. \n11.57  Comparing various debt vulnerability indicators of India with peer countries for 2021 \ninforms that the country is in a better position in terms of relatively low levels of total debt as a \npercentage of Gross National Income (GNI) and short-term debt as a percentage of total debt.

The empirical \nliterature documents that global growth exerts a strong statistically and economically significant \nimpact on India’s real exports, though the impact has reduced over the years.26 As noted earlier \n(para 11.2), global growth is forecast to slow down in 2022 and 2023 as per IMF estimates.  This is the weakest growth profile since 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acute phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. \n11.59 Thus, the export outlook may remain flat in the coming year if global growth does not \npick up in 2023, as indicated by many forecasts. In such cases, product basket and destination \ndiversification which India is taking through FTAs would be useful to enhance trade opportunities. At times when the base (global growth and global trade) is not growing, export growth will have to come predominantly through market share gains. In turn, that comes from the focus on efficiency, productivity, technology, and innovation. That game has to be lifted. Governments can try and open markets through FTAs. But, to take advantage of that is in the hands of private sector participants.\n11.60  India is facing competition from South Asian countries in a few of its export competitive \nproducts. In the textile sector, Bangladesh and Vietnam are seen to be expanding their exports \nglobally, in recent years. Further, Vietnam has been able to expand its exports in machinery and equipment; computers, electronic products, certain agriculture products etc. However, given the benefits of the lower average age of the working population along with the advantage of economies of scale, India has the potential to cater to the global demand for several products in a cost-effective manner.\n11.61  On the imports side, notwithstanding uncertainty surrounding the outlook on global \ncrude oil prices, the recent softening in its prices augurs well for India’s POL imports. However, \nnon-oil, non-gold imports, which are growth-sensitive, may not witness a significant slowdown as Indian growth continues to be resilient. \n11.62 While recognising the potential adverse developments, it is important to take cognisance \nof innate buffers to India’s external sector. India’s export of services, primarily contributed by \nsoftware, business, and travel services, while remaining robust during the year so far, embodies a greater degree of resilience. India is cementing its position as the top remittance receiver in the world, with inward remittances projected to be at record levels during 2022. Accordingly, a large surplus under services and remittances would cushion the widening trade deficit. Consolidating an increasing share of non-debt flows in financing CAD over the years, net FDI flows remained robust during the current year, while the net FPI inflows turned positive in recent months. Thus, the CAD would be within manageable limits and eminently financeable. Above all, the forex reserves remained comfortable at US$ 562.7 billion as of end-December 2022, covering 9.3 months of imports. The stock of India’s external debt has been prudently managed. \n26Chinoy, S. Z and Jain, T (2018): What Drives India’s Exports and What Explains the Recent Slowdown? New Evidence and Policy  \nImplications; NCAER, Policy Forum; https://www.ncaer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/a4.pdf340\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n11.63 From a cross-country perspective too, India’s external sector has fared relatively \nbetter and hence positioned relatively stronger to face the evolving adverse global scenario as \nevidenced by the Indian rupee outperforming most EME currencies, comfortable import cover and moderate CAD. India’s external debt vulnerability indicators are benign by international standards. To sum up, while India’s external sector faces challenges, it is performing relatively better as compared to many of its peers as it has inbuilt shock absorbers to weather them. CHAPTER12\nThe invention of the wheel set in motion the necessity of travelable paths, and since then \nthe saga of infrastructure has expanded from canals to modern capital structures such as railways, roads etc. depending on the necessities of the region. In the last 75 years in India since Independence, infrastructure development has moved on a consistent growth curve building the assets required by the nation across sectors such as transportation, housing, commercial development, telecom and most recently, sanitation. As a key enabler of socio-economic enhancement of a region, the government has used ‘social overhead capital’ to push development in the remotest areas of the country through dedicated budgetary allocation, cross-subsidising revenue-generating infrastructure and focussed programme delivery. This has helped in expanding physical transportation and connectivity, providing services at point-of-use and deepening digital penetration.\nInfrastructure, being a melange of numerous sectors, its multiplier effects in the economy \ncannot be realised if it operates in silos. Thus, in 2019, Government of India adopted a forward-looking programmatic approach towards infrastructure. The National Infrastructure Pipeline was born with a projected investment of around ₹111 lakh crore for FY20-25 for developing a comprehensive view of infrastructure development in the country, monitoring its progress at the highest levels in the government for timely completion, and enabling a pipeline view for investors for them to plan infrastructure investments. The funding for infrastructure comes from a variety of sources, from government to private sector to multilateral. However, given the quantum of funding involved, a creative financing option such as asset monetisation was also envisaged through the 5 lakh crore National Monetisation Pipeline. Apart from generating critical financial resources, private participation in running risk-free brownfield assets will also help in ushering in operational efficiencies and better management of public assets. \nThe programmatic approach to infrastructure is complemented by structural and \nfinancial reforms such as infrastructure financing options of InvITs and REITs, creation of Dedicated Financing Institution (NaBFID), recapitalisation of other sectoral DFIs, push to PPP ecosystem through Model Concession Agreements by line ministries and enabling social infrastructure development through the revamped Viability Gap Funding scheme.\nTo bring in further convergence with comprehensive planning across centre and states, \nPM GatiShakti has sectoral complementarity of logistics facilitation through the National Logistics Policy launched in Sept 2022. All of this is expected to tighten the nuts and bolts for the arduous infrastructure journey that our country has undertaken together by the Physical and digital  \ninfrastructure: lifting \nPotential growth342\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nparticipation of centre, state, local governments and the private sector.\nThis story has seen many successes. While roads, railways, and waterways have \nseen unprecedented expansion in the last eight years, ports and airports have been substantially upgraded. This has also helped the country move from unimodal to multi-modal transportation, providing a window of opportunity to the private sector to invest and reinvest in these assets, which has already been facilitated by the policy of asset monetisation.  Extending infrastructural facilities is only part of the story; modernisation is the other important principle that has been attempted with verve and achieved with commendable speed.  \nIn keeping with the winds of change around the globe, we have placed a great emphasis \non digital and communications development, but, have taken the principle to new heights in terms of usability, interoperability and accessibility. The country has come a long way from a time when a basic telephone connection was viewed as a luxury, to a stage where most individuals now have a mobile connection. It is not a hyperbole to state that with the thrust on Digital India, the story of digital infrastructure and services in India will always be seen by the world with a certain regard and appreciation. In a very short time, the country has seen a great multiplier effect on social and economic growth through the different uses of digital enablement led by the humble mobile phone and the Aadhar number– targeted beneficiary identification for various benefits, provision of healthcare and education services and financial inclusion.  Close on this, arrived the success story of India’ s sui-generis payment infrastructure (UPI), which travelled internationally with select adoption and global acclaim. The bouquet of digital public infrastructure products like e-rupi,e-way bill, TReDS for MSMEs etc have ensured real value for money to consumers while reducing the compliance burden for producers.  And now, with the vision of $1 trillion digital economy by 2025, the government is marching towards providing more and more e-governance based services.\nAll of these developments are a testament to the fact that India has been one of the few \ncountries where innovation in technology and digital connectivity has been and continues to be led by the public sector. The success of UPI, a common platform that serves as the backbone for diverse developments, has prompted government to task itself with another innovative attempt towards democratising digital commerce through the ONDC which could potentially transform how businesses and consumers interact at present. Empowering the end-users with control over their data is an essential ongoing task that is guided by the Account Aggregator framework. \nAs the developments would indicate, the world has moved seamlessly from the focus \non physical infrastructure to investing in digital infrastructure. Moving forward, it is almost a certainty that most of the future real-world applications are going to marry the two, something akin to that attempted under Smart Cities, that interlocks area-based development with digital assets and digital services. \nIn the context of unique challenges, which only a country with a billion people can face, \nIndia’ s infrastructure journey has been global in outlook, but domestic in innovation and implementation.343\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nintroduction\n12.1 As India completes 75 years of Independence, the nation is evolving into a prominent \nforce in the global economic order. India is the world’s fifth largest economy and the prospect of \nsteady progress in the coming years is bright. Here, the critical role played by infrastructure in economic growth cannot be overemphasised. Investing in high-quality infrastructure\n1 is crucial \nfor accelerating economic growth and sustaining it in the long run. As the empirical evidence states, this has a salutary effect on the productivity and efficiency of Indian manufacturing firms\n2. \nIt further plays a significant role in poverty reduction3 and promotes both rural and agricultural \ndevelopment4,5. Empirical evidence also points to the positive effect of infrastructure towards \nbringing overall economic growth in India6. \nfigure Xii.1: Quantity and quality of infrastructure and level of  \neconomic development across countries are strongly correlated\n 020000400006000080000100000\n100 600 1100 1600 2100GDP per capita, current \ninternational $\nTotal infrastructure investment per \ncapita, constant 2015 US$Correlation: 0.75\n020000400006000080000100000120000\n1 3 5 7GDP per capita, current \ninternational $\nQuality of overall infrastructureCorrelation: 0.76\nNote: The left graph pertains to 2019, and the right graph pertains to 2018.\nQuality of overall infrastructure: 1=worst and 7=best.Source: World Bank, Global Infrastructure Hub, and World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index\n12.2 The above correlation between infrastructure and development brings us to the present \nscenario when during the times of pandemic and geo-political crisis, the government kept its \nfocus on reforms in areas of physical, digital and regulatory infrastructure. In order to increase the private sector participation in creation of new infrastructure and development of existing ones, the government took initiatives like Public-Private Partnership (PPP), National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP). In addition to this, as part of the structural reforms with the objective to enhance efficiencies and cost competitiveness, Gati \n1\u2002In a broad sense, the term infrastructure refers to the “…physical facilities, institutions and organisational structures, or the social and eco-\nnomic foundations, for the operation of a society” (World Investment Report 2008: Transnational Corporations and the Infrastructure Challenge. \nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development.). The present chapter focuses only on emerging issues in the context of physical and digital infrastructure. Separate chapters of this survey provide in-depth views on social infrastructure and financial infrastructure related issues.\n2\u2002Mitra, A., Varoudakis, A., & Véganzonès‐Varoudakis, M. (2002).

This buffet of reforms on all \naspects related to infrastructure investment and project execution not just ensures economic growth and economic efficiency but also generates confidence among various stakeholders in the economy towards government functioning.\n12.3 Building upon it, the government has also kept its focus towards developing the traditional \ninfrastructure like roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport and waterways.  These play a \nvital role in national integration and regional development. The mechanisms like multi-modal transport system have also been put in place. The multi-modal connectivity will provide integrated and seamless connectivity for movement of people and goods from one mode of transport to another. It will facilitate the last mile connectivity and also reduce travel time for people, further reducing the logistics cost and promoting export competitiveness. These measures collectively can bring out the untapped potential of underutilised modes of infrastructure.\n12.4 With increasing financialisation of the economy and penetration of digital services, growth \nin physical infrastructure alone could not be the answer for development. Though India\'s digital \njourney predates the pandemic, it would be rational to say that the testing times of the pandemic have accelerated its acceptance, application and coverage in many ways. The adaptability displayed by the citizens towards technology-driven changes was very encouraging. This confluence of digitisation and innovation acted as a game changer for India. \n12.5 Reflecting on the journey of digital infrastructure growth and its global adoption, it is \npertinent to mention that in 2009, only 17 per cent of adults in India had bank accounts, 15 \nper cent used digital payments, 1 in 25 had a unique ID document, and about 37 per cent had mobile phones. Today, these numbers have seen a meteoric rise — tele density has reached up to 93 per cent, over a billion people have a digital ID document, more than 80 per cent have bank accounts, and as of 2022, over 600 crore of digital payment transactions are completed per month. A Bank for International Settlements (BIS) working paper\n7 has estimated that progress \ntowards financial inclusion, which would have taken almost half a century had India followed traditional growth processes, was achieved in India in just about ten years. \n12.6 Today, India is able to offer many best practices, particularly with respect to its digital \ninfrastructure innovations, that can be emulated globally. Successful vaccination drive through \nthe one-stop Co-WIN portal, DigiLocker, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN), Goods and Services Tax (GST) Sahay are a few success stories among many. The National Payments Corporation of India International (NPCIL) led Unified Payment Interface (UPI) is another such innovation which transformed the payment landscape. UPI based transactions grew both in value and volume terms, paving the way for its international adoption. \n12.7 Capitalising on the digital infrastructure support, India has also emerged as one of the \nworld\'s most vibrant destinations for start-up ecosystems. Start-ups are being envisioned as the \nspine of new India, as they encourage the youth to become job creators rather than job seekers. With the highest FinTech adoption rate of 87 per cent among the public compared to the global average of 64 per cent, India has gained the 3rd place in digital payments\n8 only after US and \n7\u2002https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap106.pdf, page 4.\n8\u2002https://bfsi.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/fintech/indias-fintech-market-size-at-31-billion-in-2021-third-largest-in-world \nreport/88794336 BLinC per cent20report_Fintech_2022.pdf345\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nChina, signifying that India has an untapped market. These untapped opportunities, along with the \nfavourable ecosystem, creates a large growth potential for FinTechs in India.  Taking this vision forward, under the government\'s policy initiative, a world-class FinTech Hub at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT) International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) has been developed.\n12.8 This is just an illustration of the opportunities that exist. The massive wave of digitisation, \nincreased penetration of smartphones, and adoption of technology have opened the doors for \nboth traditional and new-age sectors. The rollout of 5G services can unleash new economic opportunities and help the country leapfrog the traditional barriers to development, spur innovations by start-ups and business enterprises, and advance the \'Digital India\' vision. The journey is far from complete, and a lot remains to be accomplished to realise our true potential. \n12.9 To summarise, this chapter covers the recent and past experiences of the government in \ntransforming and inter-locking the potential of physical, regulatory and digital infrastructure. \nIn doing so, the chapter looks to answer the following: How have the various infrastructural sectors fared after the Covid-19 shock? How has the government leveraged digital technologies in the service of the public? How far has the government been able to determine the role of  \nco-ordination and efficiency in infrastructure projects and what is the government’s vision towards infrastructure development? In doing so, we will cover the government’s plans to place India among the top three global economies and inch closer to the status of a developed nation by the 100th year of its Independence. \ngovernment’s Vision and approaches to infrastructure development in india\n12.10 Increase in infrastructure investment provides a critical push to the potential growth of \nthe economy. The government, in recent years, provided an increased impetus for infrastructure development and investment through the enhancement of capital expenditure. This push has happened at a time of crisis when the capital expenditure by the private sector has been subdued. The outlay (target) for capital expenditure in 2022-23 (BE) was increased sharply by 35.4 per cent from ₹ 5.5 lakh crore in the previous year (2021-22) to ₹ 7.5 lakh crore, of which approximately 67 per cent has been spent from April to December 2022. \nfigure Xii.2: central government has sharply increased capital \nexpenditure in the last two consecutive years*\n 3.44.15.57.5\n13%22%34%35%\n0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%\n0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.0\nFY20 FY21 FY22 FY23\ngrowth (per cent)Capital ex penditure (₹ Lakh Crore)\nGBS YoY growth in Capex\n   * All figures are representative of Budgeted Estimates for the respective Financial Year\n   Source: Union Budget of India346\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n12.11  The result of the efforts is visible in Ministries’/ Departments’ Capex spending till \nDecember 2022, which has been ₹5 lakh crore (around 67 per cent has been achieved against \nthe Budgeted Capex of 7.5 lakh crore) as against ₹3.9 lakh crore for the same period in FY22 (i.e., till December 2021). The actual expenditure in FY23 is also 28 per cent higher than the expenditure in FY22 for the corresponding period.\n12.12  The steady increase in public capital expenditure has helped support economic growth \nwhile laying the foundation for future growth as capital assets boost economic efficiency and \npotential growth. It could also crowd in private investment, as the IMF observed in the case of India\n9. This is evident from the fact that capacity utilisation in the private sector has been \nrecovering.\n12.13 While the NIP and the NMP would provide the much-needed impetus for stepping up \ninfrastructure investment, the NLP will address the gaps in services, digital infrastructure and \nskills in the logistics workforce. PM GatiShakti, with a multimodal approach, is designed to fill the gaps in physical infrastructure and to integrate existing and proposed infrastructure development initiatives of different agencies. As physical infrastructure requires continuous support over its long gestation period, the government has also set up National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) as development financial institution to set in motion a virtuous investment cycle. An institutional mechanism to fast-track investments has been put in place, in the form of Project Development Cells (PDCs) in all concerned Ministries/ Departments of Government of India. \n12.14 The government’s vision for infrastructure does not stop here. As India has already \nsubmitted its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy at COP27, the next leap would \nbe towards advanced infrastructure, which is more energy efficient, incorporates the idea of a circular economy and transitions towards low carbon development. The amount of investment that may be needed for putting in place climate resilient and climate resistant infrastructure might be too vast to be provided for by either the public sector or the private sector alone. Both financing and the creation of such infrastructure are likely to require Public-Private Partnership, a topic to which we turn next.\nPublic-Private Partnerships (PPPs)\n12.15 Private investment in infrastructure is mainly in the form of PPPs. PPPs are vital instruments \nfor governments in channelling the strength of private sector in critical areas of infrastructure. It helps to address infrastructure gap and improve efficiency in infrastructure service delivery. The very success of PPPs lies in the robustness of institutional structure, financial support, and use and availability of standardised documents, such as Model Request for Qualification (RFQ), Model Request for Proposal (RFP) and Model Concession Agreements (MCAs).\n12.16 In India, private participation in infrastructure programmes supports several PPP models, \nincluding management contracts like Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), Design-Build-Finance-\nOperate-Transfer (DBFOT), Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer (ROT), Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM), and Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) model. Under the BOT model, there are two variants – BOT (Toll) and BOT (Annuity) depending on who bears the traffic risk. In the case of BOT \n9\u2002Bahal, Girish & Raissi, Mehdi & Tulin, V olodymyr. (2018). Crowding-Out or Crowding-In? Public and Private Investment in India.347\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\n(Toll), the traffic risk is borne by the PPP concessionaire, while in the case of BOT (Annuity), it \nis borne by the public authority. \n12.17  The Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC), the apex body for appraisal \nof PPP projects in the Central Sector has streamlined appraisal mechanism to ensure speedy \nappraisal of projects, eliminate delays, adopt international best practices and have uniformity in appraisal mechanism and guidelines. The PPPAC is chaired by Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) with Secretaries of Department of Expenditure, Department of Legal Affairs, the Sponsoring Ministry/Department and CEO, NITI Aayog as members to consider and appraise the \nproposals for Central Sector PPP Projects. The Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee \nhas cleared 79 projects with a total project cost of ₹2,27,268.1 crore from FY15 to FY23.\n12.18 To provide financial assistance to financially unviable but socially/ economically \ndesirable PPP projects, DEA launched the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme in 2006. Under \nthis scheme, economic sector projects may get up to 40 per cent of Capex as VGF grant. The Scheme includes higher provisions of VGF grant for social sectors. Social sectors may get up to 80 per cent of the Capex and up to 50 per cent of the Operating Expenditure (Opex) for five years after Commercial Operation Date (CoD) as VGF grant.      \n12.19  Social Sector projects get VGF under two categories: Sub Scheme-1 and Sub-Scheme-2. \nSub-Scheme-1 caters to social sectors such as wastewater treatment, water supply, solid waste \nmanagement etc. The projects under this category should have at least 100 per cent Operational Cost recovery. The Government of India (GoI) will provide a maximum of 30 per cent of Capex and the State Government concerned may provide an additional support of up to 30 per cent of Capex. Sub-scheme 2 supports demonstration/pilot projects from Health & Education sectors. The projects eligible under this category should have at least 50 per cent Operational Cost recovery.  The GoI will provide a maximum of 40 per cent of the Capex of the project and a maximum of 25 per cent of the Opex of the project for the first five years of commercial operations as VGF.\n12.20 From 2014-15 to 2022-23, under the VGF Scheme, 56 projects with TPC of ₹57870.1 \ncrore were granted In-Principle Approval and 27 projects with TPC of ₹25263.8 crore were \ngranted final approval with a Total Viability Gap Funding approval of ₹5813.6 crore (Both GoI & State Share). The GoI share of approved VGF is ₹3102.6 crore and the State Share of Total VGF approved is ₹2710.9 crore. The total VGF amount disbursed by DEA under the scheme from FY15 to FY23 is ₹2982.4 crore. \n12.21 A scheme for financial support for project development expenses of PPP Projects – \nthe ‘India Infrastructure Project Development Fund Scheme’ (IIPDF) – was notified by the \ngovernment on 3 November 2022. The aim of the scheme is to develop quality PPP projects by providing necessary funding support to the project-sponsoring authorities, both in the Central and State Governments, for creating a shelf of bankable, viable PPP projects by on-boarding transaction advisers. \n12.22  IIPDF Scheme has a total outlay of ₹150 crore for a period of 3 years from FY23 to \nFY25. Under the scheme, a maximum amount of ₹5 crore for a single proposal, inclusive of any \ntax implications, can be funded, which can include the cost of consultants/transaction advisers of a PPP project. Any funding requirement over and above ₹5 crore may be borne by the project sponsoring authority itself, and funding under IIPDF shall not be recovered.348\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nnational infrastructure Pipeline (niP)\n12.23 A developing economy such as ours requires a continued stepping up of infrastructure \ninvestment to sustain a high rate of growth, which in turn is a pre-requisite for achieving wide-\nranging social objectives. In view of this, the government launched the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) with a forward-looking approach and with a projected infrastructure investment of around ₹111 lakh crore during FY20-25 to provide high quality infrastructure across the country. It also envisages improving project preparation and attracting domestic and foreign investment in infrastructure. The NIP includes infrastructure projects of more than ₹100 crore \ncovering greenfield and brownfield investments. The NIP currently has 8,964 projects with \na total investment of more than ₹108 lakh crore under different stages of implementation. Regarding sectoral composition, the transport sector constituted more than half of the projects. \nfigure Xii.3: status of Projects under niP\n  - 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\nUnder Conceptualization Under Development Under Implementation₹ lakh croreTotal Project Cost  Total Capital Outlay\n   Source: Department of Economic Affairs. \n   Note: Data as of 13 January 2023\nfigure Xii.4: transportation sector dominates the niP\n  - 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nCom mercial\nInfrastructureCommunication Energy Logistics Social\nInfrastructureTransport Water &\nSanitation₹ lakh croreTotal Project Cost Total Capital Outlay\n \u2002 Source: Department of Economic Affairs. \n \u2002 Note: Data as of 13 January 2023\n12.24 NIP is hosted on the Invest India Grid (IIG) platform and provides opportunities for \nStates/UTs and Ministries to collate all major infrastructure projects at a single location. IIG thus \nacts as a centralised portal to track and review project progress across all economic and social infrastructure sub-sectors. The portal also enables project-sponsoring authorities to showcase investment opportunities to national and international investors. Project Monitoring Group (PMG) is an institutional mechanism put in place by the government for resolution of issues related to large-scale projects. PMG is also involved in the fast-tracking of approvals/clearances 349\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nfor projects with an anticipated investment of ₹500 crore and above. Now, it has been proposed \nto integrate NIP and PMG portals. When implemented, NIP will become the first entry point (database) for all infrastructure projects (costing ₹100 crore or more). PMG portal will pick up data, as per requirements (project cost of  ₹500 crore or more), from the NIP database. This will save substantial time and effort by Ministries and States/UTs and ease the monitoring of large infrastructure projects.\nnational Monetisation Pipeline – creation through monetisation \n12.25  The need for scaling up infrastructure investment despite fiscal pressures from Covid-19 \npandemic required unlocking of capital from various projects across sectors. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), was thus announced on 23 August 2021. Based on the principle of ‘asset creation through monetisation’, it taps private sector investment for new infrastructure creation. \n12.26  It is expected that private players would operate and maintain the assets. The NMP provides \nan opportunity for deleveraging balance sheets and providing fiscal space for investment in new \ninfrastructure assets. The estimated aggregate monetisation potential under NMP is ₹6.0 lakh crore through core assets of the Central Government, over a four-year period, from FY20-25. \n12.27  The process of monetisation entails a limited period license/ lease of an asset, owned by \nthe government or a public authority, to a private sector entity for upfront or periodic consideration. \nFunds so received by the public authority are reinvested in new infrastructure or deployed for other public purposes. Such contracts include provisions for the transfer of assets back to the authority at the end of the contract period. It includes a selection of de-risked and brownfield assets with a stable revenue generation profile (or long-term revenue rights) that can be clearly ring-fenced. It contains 20+ asset classes across 12+ line ministries/ departments.  In addition, the top 5 sectors (by estimated value) capture around 83 per cent of the aggregate pipeline value: roads (27 per cent) followed by railways (25 per cent), power (15 per cent), oil & gas pipelines (8 per cent), and telecom (6 per cent). Roads and railways together contribute around 52 per cent of the total NMP value.\n12.28 Against the monetisation target of ₹0.9 lakh crore in FY22, ₹0.97 lakh crore have been \nachieved during the period under roads, power, coal and mines. The cumulative investment \npotential over the years of transactions completed is estimated at ₹9.0 lakh crore (value captured in the form of accruals, receipts, and/or private investment). NMP’s 2nd year, i.e., FY23, target envisaged is ₹1.6 lakh crore (27 per cent of overall NMP Target) under Core-Asset Monetisation. This is an indicative value while the actual realization for public assets may differ depending on the timing, transaction structuring, investor interest, etc.\nnational logistics Policy: reducing the cost of logistics\n12.29 Given that India aims to increase its exports manifold, it is important that the logistics \naspects, that will facilitate this goal, be addressed. Logistics costs in India have been in the range of 14-18 per cent of GDP against the global benchmark of 8 per cent. Key dimensions to be addressed to improve logistics for trade include: ensuring efficiency of the clearance process (i.e., speed, simplicity, and predictability of formalities) by border control agencies, including customs; improving the quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure (e.g., ports, railroads, roads, information technology); easing of arranging competitively priced shipments; enhancing the competence and quality of logistics services (e.g., transport operators, customs brokers); 350\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nproviding for tracking and tracing of consignments and ensuring timeliness of shipments in \nreaching destinations within the scheduled or expected delivery time. These aspects have been captured by the World Bank in the form of a Logistics Performance Index (LPI).\n12.30 Many efforts have already been made by the Government of India to improve the logistics \necosystem through ‘infrastructure initiatives’ such as Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN), \nBharatmala, Sagarmala, Parvatamala, National Rail Plan, and through ‘process reforms’ GST, e-Sanchit, Single Window Interface for Trade (SWIFT), Indian Customs Electronic Data Interchange Gateway (ICEGATE), Turant Customs, and others.\n12.31 However, a need was felt to integrate all these efforts by different government agencies \nand lay an overarching interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral, and multi-jurisdictional framework for \nthe logistics sector. To realise this idea, NLP was launched on 17 September 2022, addressing the components of improving efficiency in logistics through streamlining processes, regulatory framework, skill development, and mainstreaming logistics among others. \n12.32 The vision of the NLP is “to develop a technologically enabled, integrated, cost-efficient, \nresilient, sustainable and trusted logistics ecosystem in the country for accelerated and inclusive \ngrowth.” The policy is an endeavour to improve the competitiveness of Indian goods, enhance economic growth and increase employment opportunities. It is aimed at bringing global standards to warehousing, multimodal digital integration, ease of logistics services, human resources, and skill enhancement.\n12.33 The targets for achieving the vision of the NLP are to (i) reduce the cost of logistics in \nIndia to be comparable to global benchmarks by 2030; (ii) improve the Logistics Performance \nIndex ranking - endeavour is to be among the top 25 countries by 2030, and (iii) create a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem.\n12.34 The Policy will be implemented through a Comprehensive Logistics Action Plan (CLAP). \nThe interventions under the CLAP are divided into specific key action areas, including Integrated \nDigital Logistics Systems, standardisation of physical assets & benchmarking service quality standards, Logistics Human Resources Development and Capacity Building, State Engagement, EXIM (Export-Import) Logistics, Service Improvement framework, Sectoral Plan for Efficient Logistics and Facilitation of Development of Logistics Parks.  \n12.35 Among other steps taken to enhance logistics performance in the country, there has been \nan initiative to undertake a sub-national view of the state of logistics in the country through \nthe Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) index. The following Box provides some details of this initiative.\n10\nBox Xii.1: logistics ease across different states\nThe Government undertook a survey-based assessment of logistics ease in various States and UTs in the form of the LEADS index in 2018 to gauge their logistics ecosystem. It was followed by surveys in 2019, 2021, and 2022\n10. Each of these surveys has been aimed at \nanalysing the business environment at the State level relating to the logistics infrastructure, policy framework, and regulatory regime, across States and UTs.\n10\u2002The survey could not be undertaken in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.351\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nIt is based on a stakeholders’ survey and uses the World Bank’s Logistics Performance \nIndex (LPI) methodology. The State LPI is arrived at using a ranking methodology for stakeholder engagement based on a series of meetings and online surveys in the key areas of logistics- infrastructure, services timelines, traceability, competitiveness, security, operating environments, and efficiency of regulation. Following the LEADS initiative, 13 States/UTs have prepared and notified their logistic policies.\nThe LEADS 2022 survey report was released on 13 October 2022, which considered the \nPM GatiShakti NMP and current developments in the logistics sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey has garnered more than 6500 responses from more than 2100 respondents across the country. Unlike the previous versions of LEADS which were based on ranking systems for all states, LEADS 2022 has adopted a classification-based grading, and States have been now classified under four categories viz., coastal States, hinterland/landlocked States, North-Eastern States, and UTs for the assessment of how well a State or UT has performed in comparison to the top State/UT within the specific cluster.\nTaking a break from the past, states have not been ranked in order. This time, they have been \nallotted three performance categories, namely, Achievers: States/UTs achieving a percentage score of 90 per cent or more, Fast Movers: States/UTs achieving percentage scores between 80 to 90 per cent, and Aspirers: States/UTs achieving percentage scores below 80 per cent. The results are indicated below.\nUttar Pradesh Kerala Goa\nTamil Nadu Sikkim Bihar\nUttarakhand Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh\nTelangana Tripura A&N Islands\nPunjab Puducherry Mizoram\nOdisha Rajasthan J&K\nKarnataka Arunachal Pradhesh\nHimachal Pradesh Ladakh\nAssam Lakshadweep\nDelhi Nagaland\nChandigarh\nHaryanaachievers fast Movers aspirers352\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nPM gatishakti: a master plan for integrated project planning\n12.36 The growth experience of advanced economies has highlighted the importance of \nhaving a multimodal transport network approach. Introducing the holistic planning in the case \nof infrastructure projects, the government launched PM GatiShakti, charting a transformative approach to infrastructure development. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan entails creation of a common umbrella platform with all infrastructure projects pertaining to various ministries/ departments incorporated within a comprehensive database for efficient planning and implementation on a real-time basis. The projects pertaining to seven engines (roads, railways, \nairports, ports, mass transport, waterways, and logistic infrastructure) in the NIP will be aligned \nwith PM GatiShakti framework. The touchstone of the Master Plan will be high quality modern infrastructure and logistics synergy among different modes of movement – both of people and of goods – and location of projects. This will help raise productivity, and accelerate economic growth and development. \n12.37  The focus is on integrated planning and synchronised implementation across ministries/\ndepartments, with innovative use of technology. The aim is to improve multimodal connectivity \nand logistics efficiency while addressing the critical gaps for the seamless movement of people and goods, with a focus on minimising disruptions and timely completion of infrastructure projects.\n12.38 In order to facilitate integrated planning and coordinated implementation, a GIS-\nbased and data-driven decision support platform called PM GatiShakti National Master Plan \nhas been introduced. Around 1950 data layers of 22 ministries/departments and 36 States/UTs were mapped up to the village, district, and taluka levels on the national master plan. It can be integrated with various applications of different ministries/agencies to prevent duplication of work and create a single window system for infrastructure planning. Data layers on important assets pertaining to health, education, culture, tourism, gram panchayats, municipal corporation, social welfare housing etc. are being mapped and data validation is being done for optimum use of PM GatiShakti principles in planning of both physical and social infrastructures. Use cases of GatiShakti National Master Plan include connectivity to model schools and disaster management planning etc.\ndevelopments in Physical infrastructure sectors\nroad transport: increased budgetary support by the government augmented road  \nconnectivity\n12.39 Road infrastructure in the form of a network of national highways, state highways, district \nroads, rural roads, and urban roads acts as a major mode of transportation and connectivity for the country’s diverse population of consumers and businesses. Roads supplement the other modes of transport through last-mile connectivity to the far-flung regions of the country.  \n12.40 There has been an increase in the construction of National Highways (NHs)/roads over \ntime, with 10,457 km of roads constructed in FY22 as compared to 6,061 km in FY16. In FY23 \n(until October 2022), 4,060 km of NHs/roads were constructed, which was around 91 per cent of the achievement in the corresponding period of the previous financial year.

The \nIndian Railways (IR), with over 68,031 route kms, is the fourth largest network in the world under single management. Passenger traffic originating in IR was 809 crore during pre-Covid-19 period (2019-20), but dipped to 125 crore in 2020-21. It has since recovered to 351.9 crore in 2021-22. During the current financial year, passenger traffic has seen further strong growth with the number of originating passengers already hitting 418.4 crore (up to November 2022). Enhanced mobility across the country and demand for faster and competitive trains will assist the growth in passenger traffic in the coming years. \n12.43 In the case of revenue-earning, freight traffic was sustained by IR despite the Covid-19 \nshock. Between FY20-21 and FY21-22, there was a sharp increase in the freight traffic, reflecting \nthe strong revival in the economic activity in the domestic economy. During FY22-23 (up to November 2022), Indian Railways (IR) carried 976.8 million tonnes of revenue-earning freight 354\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\ntraffic (excluding KRCL11), as against 901.7 million tonnes during the corresponding period in \nFY21-22 (excluding KRCL), which translated into an increase of 8.3 per cent.\nfigure Xii.7: railways passenger as well as freight traffic have seen strong growth post covid-19 period\n  \n 01002003004005006007008009001000\n2014-15\n2015-16\n2016-17\n2017-18\n2018-19\n2019-20\n2020-21\n2021-22\n2022-23*Railway Passenger Traffic (in Crore)1415.9\n105011001150120012501300135014001450\n2014-15\n2015-16\n2016-17\n2017-18\n2018-19\n2019-20\n2020-21\n2021-22Revenue earning freight traffic\n(excl.

It has seen a continuous increase in the last four years with Capex (B.E.) of \n₹2.5 lakh crore in FY23, up by around 29 per cent compared to the previous year. During the current financial year (till 12 December 2022), IR has already completed 2022 Track Kilometres (TKM) which includes 109 TKM of New Line, 102 TKM of Gauge Conversion and 1811 TKM of  \nmulti-tracking projects. To understand the pace of progress, it may be noted that during last financial year this figure was reached only during the first week of March. From FY2014-22, across IR, 20,628 km sections (3,970 km New Line, 5,507 km Gauge Conversion and 11,151 km doubling) have been commissioned at an average of 2,579 km/year, which is 70 per cent more than the average commissioning during 2009-14 (1,520 km/year). Further, during the last eight years (2014-22), 30,446 Route Kilometres (RKM) have been electrified compared to an electrification of 4,698 RKM during the previous eight-year period, a more than six-fold increase. \ntable Xii.1: infrastructure capital expenditure on railways has seen a tremendous boost\ndescriptionaverage during \n2009-14average during \n2014-192019-20 2020-21 2021-222022-23 \n(Be)\n(₹ crore)\nNL, GC & Doubling 10,623 40,389 52,446 43,597  66,690  78,576\nRolling stock 16,029 20,878 37,339 32,627  41,406  39,853\nRailway Electrification 884 3,258 7,145 6,148   6,961  7,700\nTrack renewals 4,958 7,186 9,391 13,523  14,082  13,335\nROB/RUB 916 3,178 3,522 4,139   4,222  8,750\nBridge Works 351 488 782 772  1,297  940\nOther Plan Heads 12,219 23,801 37,440 54,375   55,609  96,646\nTotal Capex 45,980 99,178 1,48,064 1,55,181  1,90,267   2,45,800\nSource: Ministry of Railways\nNote: NL: New lines, GC: Gauge Conversion\n11\u2002KRCL: Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd.355\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\n12.45 The fast pace of infrastructure augmentation by IR has been a result of substantial \nincrease in allocation of funds and various steps being taken by the government. This includes \ndelegation of powers at the field level which has helped in commissioning of doubling projects, close monitoring of the progress of projects at various levels, regular follow-up with State Governments and relevant authorities for expeditious land acquisition, forestry and wildlife clearances and resolving other issues pertaining to the projects.\nBox Xii.2:  Major initiatives of the indian railways\n Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) Project: The MAHSR project, which was sanctioned by the government in 2015, with technical and financial cooperation from Government of Japan, is under execution and survey & design aspects of it have been finalised. \n Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) Project: One of the most ambitious and biggest ever infrastructure project in the railways, which comprises construction of two dedicated freight corridors, i.e., Eastern and Western DFCs along the golden quadrilateral, will offer higher transport output in the country with reduced transit time and cost.\n GatiShakti Multi-Modal Cargo Terminal (GCT): GCTs are being developed by private players on non-railway land   as well as fully/ partially on railway land, based on demand from industry and potential of cargo traffic. 21 GCTs have been commissioned and more than 90 more locations have been provisionally identified for development of GCTs (as of 31 October 2022). This will boost investment from industry in the development of additional terminals for handling rail cargos.\n Induction of semi-high-speed Vande Bharat Trainsets:  Semi High-Speed Self-Propelled Vande Bharat Trainsets were manufactured by Integral Coach Factory, Chennai, with indigenous efforts. These trains have ultra-modern features like quick acceleration, substantial reduction in travel time, having maximum speed of 160 kmph, on-board infotainment and Global Positioning System (GPS) based passenger information system, etc.\n Electrical/Electronic Interlocking System: envisages centralized operation of points and signals to enhance safety in train operations. These systems have been provided at 6,322 stations covering 99 per cent stations of Indian Railways (as of 30 September 2022). \n Development of Hyperloop technology: Hyperloop is an emerging transportation technology that can be faster and greener than airplanes and railways. In this system, vehicles run in the levitating state (with the help of Linear Induction Motors/Electromagnets) and in vacuum environment. The technology is still in the development phase. Indian Railways intends to develop a demonstrative project on Hyperloop Technology. Indian Railways has collaborated with IIT Madras for developing Hyperloop Technology by setting up Centre of Excellence for Hyperloop Technology at IIT Madras at the cost of ₹8.34 crore.\n Kisan Rail trains were introduced in FY21 to enable speedy movement of perishables from production or surplus regions to consumption or deficient regions. Up to 31 October 2022, Indian Railways have operated 2,359 Kisan Rail services, transporting approximately 7.91 lakh tonnes of perishables including fruits and vegetables.356\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nCivil Aviation: Revival backed by domestic demand\n12.46 With the containment of Covid-19 infections and the lifting of travel restrictions \nworldwide, air travel has rebounded. While in FY21, there was a considerable decline in the \nair-traffic (a decline of 54 per cent) as well as passenger traffic handled (a decline of 66 per cent), FY22 saw a recovery, mainly led by the domestic sector. The current financial year has further shown a rebound, with both passenger and cargo movement close to the pre-Covid-19 levels. The total number of passengers carried in December 2022 stood at 150.1 lakh, which was 106.4 per cent of the pre-Covid level (average for 11 months from April 2019 to February 2020).

This is further supported by the government through schemes such as UDAN, which has considerably enhanced regional connectivity through the opening of airports in India’s hinterland. Under this scheme, the government has approved a budget of ₹4500 crore for revival of existing unserved/ underserved airports/airstrips of the State governments, Airports Authority of India (AAI), public sector undertakings and civil enclaves. The government has also accorded \'in-principle\' approval for the setting up of 21 greenfield airports across the country. More than one crore air passengers have availed themselves of the benefit of the UDAN scheme since its inception. The scheme focuses on the connectivity between the Tier-2 and 3 cities in the country and the number of beneficiaries will increase manifold as the connectivity improves between unserved and underserved airports.\nPorts: handling higher capacity with governance reforms\n12.48 For ages, the sea has been the source of opportunity and seashores have acted as the \ngateways to prosperity for India. The development of ports is crucial for the economy, given that 357\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nmost of the international trade is handled through ports (around 90 per cent of international trade \ncargo by volume and 79.9 per cent by value). The capacity of major ports, which was 871.5 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) at the end of March 2014, has increased to 1534.9 MTPA by the end of March 2022. Cumulatively they handled 720.1 MT traffic during FY22.\n12.49 To meet the ever-increasing trade requirements, the expansion of port capacity has been \naccorded the highest priority by the government through the implementation of well-conceived \ninfrastructure development projects. To further enhance their efficiency, the government is focusing on improving port governance, addressing low-capacity utilisation, modernising berths with techno efficient loading/unloading equipment, and creating new channels for port connectivity. For streamlining the port compliances and for reducing the Turn Around Time for (TAT) for vessels, long strides have been taken at the major ports towards the digitisation of key EXIM processes. The Port Community System (PCS 1x) has digitised processes such as Electronic Invoice (e-Invoice), Electronic Payment (e-Payment) and Electronic Delivery Order (e-DO) for the physical release of cargo by custodians, in addition to the processes of generating electronic Bill of Lading (e-BL) and Letter of Credit (LC). Further, the Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) solution has been implemented at all major ports to enable seamless movement of traffic across port gates, including substantial reductions in documentation checks. Additionally, the process to bootstrap PCS 1x into National Logistics Portal-Marine (NLP-Marine) is already under way which will act as a Unified Digital Platform for all maritime stakeholders. \ninland water transport: tapping the potential of navigable waterways\n12.50 Inland water transport holds great untapped potential as a means for the transportation of \ngoods and passengers. India has a large endowment of rivers, canals, and other waterways. The total navigable length of waterways in India is around 14,850 kilometres. \nfigure Xii.9: navigable length of waterways in different states\n 050010001500200025003000350040004500\nWest Bengal\nAssam\nKerala\nOdisha\nKarnataka\nAndhra Pradesh\nBihar\nMaharashtra\nUttar Pradesh **\nNagaland\nGoa\nTamil NaduKilometres\nSource: Statistics of Inland Water Transport 2020-21, Ministry of Port, Shipping and Waterways\nNote: Data pertains to 2020-21. **Data for Uttar Pradesh pertains to 2016-17358\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n12.51 Under the National Waterways Act 2016, 106 new waterways have been declared as \nNational Waterways (NWs), taking the total number of NWs in the country to 111. Based on the \noutcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs), 26 NWs viable for cargo movement have been prioritised, out of which developmental activities have been initiated in the 14 most viable NWs. Further, to promote the use of inland waterways, waterway usage charges levied by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) on vessels moving on NWs were waived in July 2020, initially for a period of three years. The cargo movement on National Waterways achieved an all-time high of 108.8 million tons during FY22, recording 30.1 per cent growth compared to the previous year.\n12.52 The Inland Vessels Bill 2021, which replaced the over 100 year-old Inland Vessels Act, \n1917 (Act No.1 of 1917), was passed by the Parliament in August 2021. This will usher in a new \nera for inland water transport sector and fulfil the vision to utilise the potential of multi-modal transport ecosystem while making the legislative framework user-friendly and promoting ease of doing business. The uniform application of rules and regulations will ensure seamless, quick, and cost-efficient trade and transportation by inland vessels using the inland waterways. Various sections of this Act as detailed in the box below have come into force in 2022. \nBox Xii.3: inland Vessels act 2021\nThe Inland Vessels Act of 1917, which had undergone several amendments, had provisions for the restrictive movement of mechanically propelled vessels and non-uniform standards and regulations across different states. The Inland Vessels Act 2021, which replaced the erstwhile Act, aims to bring uniformity in the application of the law relating to inland waterways and navigation within the country. Some salient features of the Act include:\n State governments may declare by notification any inland water area as a “Zone” depending on the maximum significant wave height criteria as prescribed in the Act. Any mechanically propelled vessel would have to obtain a certificate, which would indicate the zone in which the vessel is to be operated.\n A central database of inland vessels would be maintained by the government.\n The standards for qualification, training, training institutes, examination, and grant of certificate of competency would be prescribed by the Central Government.\n Standards for prevention of environmental pollution.\n Constitution of a Development Fund by the State Government to be utilised for meeting emergency preparedness, containment of pollution, removal of unidentified wrecks or obstruction, boosting development works of inland water navigation, etc.\nOverall, the new Act would lead to uniformity of rules across states ensuring unhindered and safe movement of vessels within and across states. This is likely to promote inland water transport as a potential mode for large-scale movement of cargo as well as passengers across the country owing to its relative cost effectiveness. 359\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nelectricity: installed capacity growth driven by renewables\n12.53 The total installed power capacity of utilities and captive power plants (industries having \ndemand of 1 Mega Watt (MW) and above) was 482.2 GW on 31 March 2022 as compared to \n460.7 GW on 31 March 2021, up by 4.7 per cent. Installed capacity in utilities was 399.5 GW on 31 March 2022 as against 382.1 GW a year back (higher by 4.5 per cent). Thermal sources of energy make up the largest (59.1 per cent) share of total installed capacity in utilities, followed by renewable energy resources with 27.5 per cent and hydro with 11.7 per cent. \ntable Xii.2: all india installed capacity Mode-w ise (gw)\nhydro thermal nuclear renewables total\n2020-21 46.3 307.4 6.8 100.1 460.7\n2021-22@ 46.9 312.2 6.8 116.4 482.2\nGrowth (in\n per cent)1.1 1.6 0 16.2 4.7\nSource: Ministry of Power. \nNote: @ Estimated\n12.54 The total electricity generated, including that from captive plants during the year FY22 \nwas 17.2 lakh GWh as compared to 15.9 lakh GWh during the FY21, of which 14.8 lakh GWh \nwas generated by utilities and 2.3 lakh GWh in captive plants. Between FY22 and FY21, the maximum rise in electricity generation was recorded in renewable energy resources for utilities and for captive plants. There has been a gradual transition in India’s energy sector from the conventional sources to the non-fossil fuel sources. India is steadfast in its commitments towards non-fossil fuel-based energy resources. India has put in place a target of achieving 50 per cent cumulative installed capacity for generating electric power from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. India is well on its way to fulfilling its commitments with the share of renewables in overall installed capacity growing at a fast pace. This is a result of the various government initiatives aimed at supporting the renewable energy sector.\ntable Xii.3: all india gross electricity generation Mode-w ise (gwh)\nhydro thermal nuclear renewables total\n2020-21 1.5 12.5 0.4 1.5 15.9\n2021-22@ 1.5 13.4 0.4 1.7 17.2\nGrowth (in\n per cent)0.9 7.3 9.5 16.2 7.6\nSource: Ministry of Power. \nNote: @ Estimated\n12.55 Government of India has been driving a vibrant renewable energy programme aimed at \nachieving energy security and energy access, and reducing the carbon footprints of the national \neconomy.

In addition, the government has introduced the Solar Park Scheme to facilitate necessary infrastructure like land, power evacuation facilities, road connectivity, water facility, etc. along with all statutory clearances. As on 30 September 2022, the government has sanctioned the entire target capacity of 40 GW for the development of 59 Solar Parks in 16 states. \n12.56 Indian Railways, which is a major user of electricity in the country, has announced \nits intention to achieve net zero carbon emission by 2030. In this regard, Indian Railways has \nreoriented its energy demand towards greater use of renewable sources. As of November 2022, plants generating about 143 MW of solar power (both on rooftops and on land) and about 103 MW of wind power have been commissioned. \n12.57 Other important incentives for renewable power generation include Hydropower \nPurchase Obligation (HPO) within Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO). With \nthe government support, the private sector has actively participated in boosting the overall generation capacity and bringing down unit costs over a short period.\ndevelopments in digital infrastructure\n12.58 While the role of traditional infrastructure has been well recognised, in recent years, \nthe role of digital infrastructure in socio-economic development of the country has assumed an increased importance. This was especially true during the Covid-19 period when the curtailment of physical interactions necessitated the utilisation of digital infrastructure already available for service delivery and remote work. In the coming years, the availability and spread of digital infrastructure will contribute significantly to economic growth. Recognising this, the government’s Digital India programme, which aims to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy, envisions digital infrastructure as a core utility to every citizen. The focus areas include the availability of high-speed internet as a core utility for delivery of services to citizens, unique digital identity, enabling citizen participation in digital and financial space, shareable private space on a public cloud (citizens can digitally store their documents, certificates, etc. and share them with public agencies or others without the need to physically submit them), and a safe and secure cyber-space. Some developments in the digital infrastructure sphere are detailed below.\nTelecommunications: Accelerating provision of affordable services\n12.59 As a result of the persistent efforts made by the government towards promoting  \ntechnological development, telecommunications services have penetrated the remotest corners of the nation. The country has come a long way from the days when a telephone connection was seen as a luxury to the present where a majority of people have a mobile connection. This was due to a cumulative effort of telecom players who widened their network bandwidth, government’s enabling environment and consumers’ outreach for smartphones. Today, the total telephone subscriber base in India stands at 117 crore (as of November 2022). While more than 97 per cent of the total subscribers are connected wirelessly (114.3 crore at the end of November 2022), 83.7 crore have internet connections as of June 2022. The overall tele-density in India stood at 84.8 per cent, with wide differences across states. It ranged from 55.4 per cent in Bihar to 270.6 per cent in Delhi. Eight license service areas, namely, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, 361\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nHimachal Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka had a tele-density of above 100 \nper cent.\nfigure Xii.10: overall tele density, license service area wise\n 050100150200250300\nAndhra Pradesh\nAssam\nBihar\nGujarat\nHaryana\nHimachal Pradesh\nJammu & Kashmir\nKarnataka\nKerala\nMadhya Pradesh\nMaharashtra\nNort h East\nOdisha\nPunjab\nRajasthan\nTamil Nadu\nUttar Pradesh (East+West)\nWest Bengal\nKolkata\nDelhi\nMumbaiteledensity (per cent)\nSource: Department of Telecommunications\n12.60 Apart from the interstate disparity in tele-density, in rural areas the tele-density continues \nto be at much lower levels compared to urban areas. However, the catch-up by the rural areas \nis heartening as the YoY change in internet subscribers is greater in rural (for the majority of the states) than in urban areas. This provided a cushion to the rural economy during the initial phase of the Covid-19 as many people went back to rural India for their livelihood. The digital infrastructure created over the years ensured not just the continuous transmission of information but also added economic value when businesses went digital.\nBox Xii.4: lessening the rural-urban digital divide\nConverting the crisis into opportunity, India, through its resilient measures, has been able to contain the impact of the pandemic through structural reforms in several sectors, telecom being one of them. During the challenging times of Covid-19 pandemic, the telecommunication sector continued to provide seamless connectivity for the smooth functioning of critical activities and services such as ‘work from home’, ‘study from home’ etc. This was supported by the significant increase in affordable smartphones, which became more than a communication device. It emerged as the key enabler of Digital India initiative with various new services and applications like digital payments, e-governance, e-commerce, e-health, and e-education. Acting as the backbone, these services have boosted the overall economic growth of the country. \nBefore 2014, access to digital services was perceived as a prerogative of urban households. 362\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nThis was substantiated by the then-existing digital divide seen from tele density (number of \nsubscribers per 100 inhabitants) in rural and urban areas being 44.01 and 145.46 respectively in 2014. However, with the vision of developing digital infrastructure as a core utility for every citizen, Digital India as an umbrella programme was launched in 2015. Service delivery through digital tools has travelled a long way since then. We have added more internet subscribers in rural areas in the last 3 years (2019-21) than in their urban counterparts (95.76 million vis-a-vis 92.81 million in rural and urban areas respectively). This has been a result of dedicated digital drives across rural areas through ambitious government schemes, like the flagship BharatNet Project Scheme, Telecom Development Plan,  Aspirational District Scheme, initiatives in North-Eastern Region through Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan (CTDP) and initiatives towards areas affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE)etc.\nfigure: lsa  wise difference in rural growth (per cent) over urban growth (per cent) in \ninternet subscribers\n -250-200-150-100-50050100150\nAndhra Pradesh\nAssam\nBihar\nDelhi\nGujarat\nHaryana\nHimachal Pradesh\nJammu & Kashmir\nKarnataka\nKerala\nKolkata\nMadhya Pradesh\nMaharashtra\nMumbai\nNort h East\nOrissa\nPunjab\nRajasthan\nTamil Nadu\nUP (East)\nUP (West)\nWest Bengalper cent\n2018 2019 2020 2021\nThis concrete focus on bridging the gap between rural and urban internet penetration has borne positive results. The plot of the difference in the growth rates (per cent) of internet subscribers in rural over urban areas is somewhat volatile across states and years. The steep transition from a negative gap in 2018 for most LSAs to above 50 per cent in positive territory (for a majority of LSAs) in 2019 reflects the demand side growth in digital services, which was backed by the availability of budget smartphones and affordable data usage. The difference has been positive since then. \nThis significant growth in rural India was the major shock absorber during the COVID-19 \npandemic when both businesses and consumer demand were impacted. When majority of the workforce reverse-migrated to rural areas in search of livelihoods, agriculture (3.4 per cent growth in FY20-21) as well as the world’s largest employment scheme MNREGA supported the domestic economy. The digital infrastructure created over the years in rural areas ensured transparent and timely payments to the beneficiaries directly into their account thus limiting their exposure to the virus. With affordability and accessibility to private education restricted, 12\n12 per cent change in Rural subscriptions -  per cent change in Urban subscriptions.363\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nthe digital support system in government schools absorbed the then much-needed enrolment \nto counter the learning gap. As schooling went online for a considerable period even post-pandemic, the increase in internet subscriptions in rural areas helped mitigate learning loss significantly. This even facilitated the successful rollout of mass vaccination in rural areas.\nThe 200 per cent increase in rural internet subscriptions between 2015 and 2021 vis-a-vis \n158 per cent in urban areas, reflects the increased impetus the government is putting to bring rural and urban digital connectivity to the same level. For further widening the net, to include unconnected areas and populations, dedicated long-term efforts by the government have been taken. Government Schemes like Production Linked Incentive (PLI) for telecom and networking products will promote domestic mobile manufacturing as well as network installation. Continuous proliferation of measures such as Bharat Net Project shall continue to improve accessibility, affordability, connectivity, and inclusivity pan-India. This in turn will help in realizing the vision of our Hon’ble Prime Minister to digitally empower every Indian, as we march towards India’s ‘Techade’.\n12.61 To further create digital linkages at the grassroots level and increase the consumer \nexperience like the one in urban centres, a project for the saturation of 4G mobile services in uncovered villages across the country has been approved. The project will provide 4G mobile services in 24,680 uncovered villages in remote and difficult areas, and 6,279 villages having only 2G/3G connectivity shall be upgraded to 4G. \n12.62 With a special focus on the states in the North-Eastern Region, the government is \nimplementing a Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan (CTDP). Under CTDP for NER, \nmobile connectivity on 2G is to be provided by setting up 2004 towers in the uncovered villages and along National Highways of Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh (National Highways only). As of 25 October 2021, 1,358 towers have been installed and they are operational. In addition, other projects on providing 4G mobile coverage to uncovered villages in Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and two districts of Assam (Karbi Anglong & Dima Hasao) are under way. Furthermore, to make available high-quality and high-speed internet access to the states of the North-Eastern Region of the country, Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) signed an Agreement with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) on 18 August 2021 for the hiring of 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) International Bandwidth for Internet Connectivity to Agartala from Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Limited (BSCCL), Bangladesh. The first 10 Gbps link was commissioned on 26 November 2021, and the second 10 Gbps link on 21 April 2022.\n12.63 When telecom is spanning coastlines, forests, and even deserts why should islands \nbe left behind? A comprehensive initiative to connect our islands to the mainland has been \nrealised through the government’s initiative of the Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan for Islands. The Submarine OFC connectivity from Chennai to Andaman & Nicobar Islands (CANI) project was launched to connect Port Blair and seven other islands of Andaman & Nicobar Islands with Chennai through 2,313 km of underwater OFC. There has been an immense 364\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nproliferation of bandwidth utilisation, almost 30 times, from 2.7Gbps to 75.7Gbps. The project \nhas led to an FTTH speed of 100 Mbps, and up to 15 times more data volume is available now. The Submarine OFC connectivity from Kochi to Lakshadweep Islands (KLI) project was launched to connect Kochi with Kavaratti and ten other islands of Lakshadweep through 1869 kms of underwater OFC project, and the project is likely to be completed by May 2023. The project is currently under way and will ensure digital inclusion across the islands and is expected to trigger significant transformation across all sectors, including agriculture, tourism, health, and education.\n12.64 A landmark achievement in telecommunications in India was the launch of 5G services. \n5G could impact consumers directly through higher data transfer speeds and lower latency. 5G \nuse cases developed by Telecom Service Providers and start-ups in education, health, worker safety, smart agriculture etc., are now being deployed across the country. Telecom reforms and clear policy direction led to the spectrum auction of 2022 garnering the highest-ever bids.\n12.65 As a major reform measure, the Indian Telegraph Right of Way (Amendment) Rules, \n2022, will facilitate faster and easier deployment of telegraph infrastructure to enable speedy \n5G rollout. The government has brought in procedural reforms in Wireless Licensing, including delicensing of various frequency bands to promote innovation, manufacturing and export. The National Frequency Allocation Plan 2022 (NFAP) provides a broad regulatory framework, identifying which frequency bands are available for cellular mobile services, Wi-fi, sound and television broadcasting, radio navigation for aircraft and ships, and other wireless communications. NFAP will give guidance to the users of the spectrum to plan their networks in accordance with the relevant frequency and parameters provided therein. Given that spectrum is a scarce resource, NFAP is useful in aligning spectrum usage with demands from emerging technologies in an efficient manner.\n12.66 To propel growth and to accelerate the provisioning of affordable services to the citizens \nin the fast-emerging area of satellite-based services, reforms have been undertaken to promote \nease of doing business by limiting the multiplicity of charges at different stages of rolling out satellite-based communication services. To simplify the existing processes, vital changes have also been carried out to streamline satellite-related clearance processes.\n12.67 Universal and equitable access to broadband services across the country, especially in \nrural areas, is an important part of the government’s vision for national digital connectivity. \nToward realising that vision, the GatiShakti Sanchar portal was launched on 14 May 2022. This portal will streamline the process of Right of Way (RoW) applications and permissions across the country. The portal has been developed keeping in view the vision areas of the National Broadband Mission at the core, which are providing broadband infrastructure as a core utility to every citizen, governance and services on demand and in particular, digital empowerment of the citizens of our country. \n12.68 Now, having discussed telecom at length, the next digital story which rings in our ears is \nradio which has been one of the best media to reach all residents of the country.365\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nBox Xii.5: radio - the waves that connected ..!!\nIn today’s fast-moving social media age, it is noteworthy how one of the components of mass \nmedia, namely the radio has not only persisted as the bulwark for outreach during the times of pandemic and beyond but in this fast-evolving digital era has also embossed a separate identity of its own in the hearts of many. Radio continues to be the most affordable and popular medium of mass communication in India and has been a tool that has consistently helped in empowerment and social development of the people of our country. The accessibility, wide coverage, variety of programmes, mobility and vernacularity have continued to be reasons for its popularity. For instance, the popular ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme where the Prime Minister establishes a dialogue with the citizens on issues of day-to-day governance reached the milestone of completing its 96th episode on 25th December 2022, with more to follow this year. \nThe iconic line “This is All India Radio. The news read by...” rings in our ears as we reminisce how \nPrasar Bharati, India\'s autonomous public service broadcaster, has not only been witness to the history and landmark events of the country, but has also been the proverbial story-teller for all citizens across the country, standing by its motto ‘Bahujan Hitaya: Bahujan Sukhaya’, meaning \'for the happiness of many, for the welfare of many\'. It broadcasts in 23 languages, 179 dialects from 479 stations across the country, reaching nearly 92 per cent of the area and 99.2 per cent of the total population of the country. Prasar Bharati marked its silver jubilee on 23 November 2022, and it is notable how it has embraced technology, reflected in the fact that over 240 radio services of All India Radio are live-streamed on NewsOnAir App, Prasar Bharati’s official App. These streams have a large number of listeners not just in India, but globally, in more than 85 countries across the world. \nAlong with the public broadcaster, private commercial radio stations (FM Radio) and \nCommunity Radio Stations (CRS) each serve as platforms for a variety of programmes. FM Radio has flourished in the last few years, as observed in the quarterly growth in private FM Radio stations, with their number increasing from 243 in the quarter ending December 2015 to 388 in quarter ending June 2022\n13.\n 200220240260280300320340360380400\nDec-15\nMar-16\nJun-16\nSep-16\nDec-16\nMar-17\nJun-17\nSep-17\nDec-17\nMar-18\nJun-18\nSep-18\nDec-18\nMar-19\nJun-19\nSep-19\nDec-19\nMar-20\nJun-20\nSep-20\nDec-20\nMar-21\nJun-21\nSep-21\nDec-21\nMar-22\nJun-22Increase in number of FM radio stations366\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\nThe rising number of FM radio stations depicts how radio as mass media has satisfactorily \ndelivered on their mandate of public service and stood strong with the people during the time of the pandemic. While FM increased its outreach to even far-flung rural areas, CRS targeted local and well-defined communities. The daunting task of spreading awareness on the pandemic, and that too in vernacular, with innumerable dialects, was made possible, as CRS channelized the community partnerships. In times when the reach of centralized media to every nook and corner of the country was a gargantuan task, these radio waves travelled without interruption for the larger public cause. They not only became a medium for information dissemination but also functioned as a channel for empowerment as virtual education also took the recourse of radio. \nWith this, we see the radio as being significantly important through good and tough times. As \nwe operate in a new normal and as things settle down with time, these small boxes requiring manual tuning may again find their place in some household cupboards. However, their identity will remain intact. It will once again come to the fore to speak for itself with the iconic line “This is All India Radio. The news read by...”.\ngrowth story of digital Public infrastructure\n12.69 The emergence of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), aimed at improving financial \nliteracy, innovation, entrepreneurship, employment generation, and empowering beneficiaries has played a critical role in uplifting the economy and bringing it to the stature where it stands today. The journey of DPI has been remarkably memorable, dating to 2009, when Aadhaar was first launched. It is fourteen years now, and the digital journey since then has taken the country quite far. The three growth drivers that acted as catalysts for DPI growth were favourable demographics, vast expansion of the middle-class, and digital behaviour patterns. By leveraging these growth drivers, India has built a competitive digital economy that empowers every individual and business to transact paperless and cashless.\n12.70 With Aadhaar establishing the authentication framework for verifying the identity of \nbeneficiaries of welfare schemes, the next logical step was to make major government services \navailable digitally. However, a lack of knowledge about the existing schemes was seen as a primary reason behind the beneficiaries’ inability to access the schemes’ benefits. ‘MyScheme’ is an e-Marketplace for schemes where users can look for suitable schemes based on their eligibility. It helps reduce users\' time and effort by doing away with the requirement of searching multiple websites of government departments and studying multiple scheme guidelines to check their eligibility. The scheme also acts as the single national platform for launching any government scheme. As on 16 January, 2023, more than 181 Central and State/UT government schemes across 14 diverse categories have been hosted on the portal.\n13 Data sourced from quarterly Performance Indicator Reports by TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India)367\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nfigure Xii.11: Myscheme portal provides information on schemes in three easy steps\n \n Source: https://www.myscheme.gov.in/, accessed on 3rd January 2023.\n12.71 To reduce the search cost for the commoners, the government launched Unified \nMobile Application for New-Age Governance (UMANG), which enables citizens to access \ne-Government services offered by the Central and State Government in various sectors such as agriculture, education, health, housing, employees, pensioners, and students’ welfare, the Public Distribution System, and others. Until 16 January 2023, UMANG catered to about 21,869 services (1,672 Central and State Govt. services and 20197 Bill Payment services) under 310+ departments of Central Government and departments of 34 States/UTs. Over 4.9 crore users are registered and benefiting from services on UMANG. Four hundred and eighty-nine DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes were made live on UMANG until September 2022. During the trying times of Covid-19, UMANG was instrumental in making available the services of EPFO for claims related to Covid-19. Around 4.9 lakh advance claims in EPFO have been raised via the UMANG Platform until September 2022. \n12.72  While the initiatives mentioned above focused on bringing the government to the doorsteps \nof the citizens, a unique initiative that deserves special mention is the Open Network for Digital \nCommerce (ONDC). ONDC aims to go beyond the current platform-centric digital commerce model where the buyer and seller can use the same platform or application for transactions. ONDC is a network-based open protocol that would connect all the buyers and sellers on the network thus bringing better visibility across the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) & Business-to-Business (B2B) landscape. In the ONDC framework, consumers can potentially discover any seller, product, or service by using any compatible application or platform. This will increase the freedom of choice for the consumers and will enable them to match demand with the nearest available supply, allowing them to choose their preferred local businesses. ONDC’s beta test in the city of Bengaluru is a major first step in operationalising a network approach to e-commerce as an alternative to a platform-centric approach. The open network system will make the e-Commerce landscape more inclusive, accessible, and experience-driven for all consumers and sellers, especially for small businesses that will exercise more freedom in business decision-making.368\nEconomic Survey 2022-23\n12.73 The government is also cognizant of the need to improve the productivity of human \ncapital. In order to promote open collaborative software development of e-governance \napplications, a platform called OpenForge has been developed. Through OpenForge, the use of open-source software and sharing and reuse of e-governance-related source code is promoted. As on 16 January 2023, there are 10,328 users on the platform, with 2,205 projects\n 14.  \n12.74 Another important domain that the government has emphasised is the availability of \nopen resources on Artificial Intelligence (AI). The national AI portal has been developed with a view to strengthening the AI ecosystem in the country by pooling together and highlighting the latest developments happening in Central and State Governments, industry, academia, NGOs, and civil societies. As on 16 January 2023, it has published 1724 articles, 829 news items, 276 videos, 127 research reports, and 120 government initiatives, all related to AI. \n12.75 In a country such as India, with its unmatched linguistic and cultural diversity, AI has \ngreat potential as a tool for overcoming the language barrier. ‘Bhashini’, the National Language \nTranslation Mission, aiming at nurturing Indian language technologies and solutions as a public good, was launched in July 2022. The Digital India Bhashini portal\n15 is a public digital platform \non which 260 open-source API-based AI models are available for speech-to-text conversion, machine translation, and text-to-speech conversion in 11 Indian languages and English for various purposes. Bhashini has great potential to bring access to the internet and other digital resources to millions of Indians in their own languages. \n12.76 The digital landscape is a fast-changing one with overarching technologies arriving at \nthe doorstep of consumers and businesses. The third generation in web technologies, ‘Web \n3.0’ is one such example where in the entire experience of the internet is changing in the way how it will be used, how websites are managed, and how internet services are provided. The horizons of internet use have broadened, and so has their deployment of better standards. The Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) is one such set of standards that is being hailed as a major shift in how lending and borrowing will be conducted in the future. This is another good initiative towards democratising lending operations and thus ensuring that small borrowers are able to avail themselves of the best terms under which credit is available. \n12.77 Today, we have a powerful story on digital public infrastructure that is finding global \nresonance. The increasing digital adoption during covid-19 in areas like healthcare, agriculture, \nFinTech, education, and skilling indicates that the digital delivery of services in India has a massive potential across economic sectors. It is usually suggested that developing countries must follow global best practices. However, how India has created and harnessed its DPI is capturing the attention of many nations globally. Low-cost accessibility (Aadhaar), the success of citizen-centric services like Unified Payments Interface (UPI), large-scale adoption and reach (DigiLocker, MyGov), and the vaccine journey through Co-Win are important and successful milestones in India’s public digital infrastructure journey.\n14 As per https://openforge.gov.in/ , last accessed 4 January 2023.\n15 https://bhashini.gov.in369\nPhysical and Digital Infrastructure: Lifting Potential Growth\nBox Xii.6: unified Payments interface - the game changer in real-time \npayments!\n‘I like how you’ve brought out the rising popularity of UPI. I laud my fellow Indians for \nembracing digital payments! They’ve shown remarkable adaptability to tech and innovation’\n                                                                                                shri narendra Modi, hon’ble PM \nUnified Payments Interface (UPI) is a system that empowers and knits multiple bank accounts \ninto a single mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features, seamless fund routing and merchant payments into one hood. It also caters to the “Peer to Peer” collection request, which can be scheduled and paid as per requirement and convenience. \nIntroduced in 2016 to revolutionize the payment landscape through universal operability, \nsingle payment address, and low-cost mobile-first payment system, UPI has acted as a positive disruption towards enabling greater digital payments adoption in the country.  UPI is a single mobile application for accessing different bank accounts. It can be accessed on all major platforms, such as Android and iOS. As the application is user-friendly and fast, consumers and merchants have displayed a great affinity to digital technology, leading to rapid growth in this digital payment infrastructure. The journey of UPI has been fascinating. The number of banks that became part of the real-time payment system increased from 35 in December 2017 to more than 380 in December 2022. Though pre-existing payment modes such as debit cards, credit cards, National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) and Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) have grown over time, UPI has shown a quantum jump comparatively to become one of the preferred modes of payment. In this sense, the progress of UPI has been remarkable.\nIn FY19, UPI accounted for 17 per cent of the country\'s total 3,100 crore digital transactions. \nThe next fiscal year saw UPI’s share rise to more than 27 per cent as it processed 1,250 crore transactions out of 4,600 crore digital transactions. In FY22, UPI accounted for 52 per cent of the total 8,840 crore financial digital transactions.\nOn average, between FY19-22 (calendar year), growth in UPI-based transactions in value and \nvolume terms have been 121 per cent and 115 per cent, respectively. Recently, in Dec 2022, UPI touched its highest-ever mark with 782 crore transactions worth ₹12.8 lakh crore at different stages of implementation, India has developed a unique and cogent digital story to tell.  The journey is ongoing and there is much untapped potential in India\'s digital public infrastructure space.\n12.87 In sum, the synergy between physical and digital infrastructure will be one of the defining \nfeatures of India\'s future growth story.')]

"A P J Abdul Kalam Departing speech 
 
 
Friends, I am delighted to address you all, in the country and those livi ng abroad, after 
working with you and completing five beautiful and eventful years in Rashtrapati 
Bhavan. Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I 
enjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one 
of you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, 
academics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, 
home makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent 
community who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at 
Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my 
online interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the 
following important messages: 
 
1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, 
 
2. Empower villages, 
 
3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, 
 
4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth 
 
5. Defeat problems and succeed, 
 
6. Overcome problems through partnership, 
 
7. Courage in combating calamities, 
 
8. Connectivity for societal transformation, 
 
9. Defending the nation: Our pride and 
 
10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. 
 
Now let me share with you each of the messages. 
 
Accelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth 
While there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl 
Anukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, 
during children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever 
after. 
 
Anukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I 
appreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that 
that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed 
India has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over 
fifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 
million youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and 
proud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. 
 
Empower Villages 
Friends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming 
office as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal 
village council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of 
village citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with 
financial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and 
vegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in 
Nagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages 
to the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which 
can take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal 
with their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban 
societies. 
 
Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness 
Now I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of 
Technology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas 
(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes 
provision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to 
economic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate 
level education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale 
employment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support 
of 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a 
cultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and 
medicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all 
running marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the 
whole region. 
 
During the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported 
by Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts 
from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core 
competence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed 
internationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO 
specialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture 
has enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to 
develop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of 
PURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to 
bridging the rural – urban divide. 
 
Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than 
6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. 
They evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual 
Garden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact 
with the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural 
scientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I 
summarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the 
agricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced 
manpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of 
“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the 
farmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the 
Scientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence 
that the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum 
through the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly

Defeat the problems and succeed 
On the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. 
As I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was 
in sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands 
and legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself 
as Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had 
happened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, 
teachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what 
I could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont 
of you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti 
entharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. 
What is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music 
could blossom in this 
person with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, 
academics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of 
course, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art 
theatre. 
 
Overcome the impact of disaster through partnership 
I had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of 
Jammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in 
2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  
Western Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of 
that area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely  damaged. 
I met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. T he villagers apprised me of 
their losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations 
along with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating 
their problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than 
allowing problems to become their master. Despite the severe l oss due to the earthquake, the children and the members of the village participated in the reli ef operation with the 
Armed Forces 
bravely and were smiling when I went to meet them. They interact ed with me and said 
that the school was functional in the temporary tents. Here, I also witnessed the 
participation of acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir along with State Government 
authorities in on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to be provide d to the victims whose 
houses had been damaged in the earth quake. I have experienced many s uch acts of 
courage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. 
 
Courage in combating calamities 
In 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha  village 
during my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation 
activities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I 
realized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many 
human losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken 
possession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in 
Car-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea"

Waves” which reads as follows: 
Sea Waves 
 
We are the children of Sea waves, 
Sea waves are my friends. 
When they become angry, 
Sea waves give the challenges. 
God has given the courage, 
To challenge the sea waves. 
And we will succeed, 
We will succeed 
With Almighty’s grace. 
All the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem  with me and exhibited 
lots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering 
during the Tsunami. 
 
Connectivity for societal transformation 
I addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johanne sburg, South 
Africa. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I 
proposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated 
satellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an 
estimated cost of US $ 100 million. 
 
As part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Afri ca), 17 Super 
Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 
tele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot proj ect on tele-education and 
tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned. Indira Gandh i National Open 
University has taken up the MBA Course for 34 Ethiopian students of Addis  Ababa and 
Harmaya Universities. As regards, tele-medicine, the special ists from CARE Hospital, Hyderabad are providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in B lack Lion 
Hospital, Addis Ababa in Cardiology and Radiology since November 2006. Using the 
Pan African network the Heads of the State in all the 53 countries  will be connected for 
instant communication. I am extremely happy that Indian experience  in bringing the 
benefits of technology to the people has enabled us to work with Afric a to bring societal 
transformation in the African continent. 
 
Defending the nation: Our pride 
I visited KUMAR in Siachen Glacier located at 17,000 feet altitude  held by the Indian 
Army, had a memorable underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak and flew  in a Sukhoi-
30 fighter experiencing 2.5 g. In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our 
ever vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of 
their duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last 
five years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in 
number of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace 
missions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence 
Forces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our 
Defence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The 
Nation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. 
Similarly, I had opportunities to interact 
with members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including 
internal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety 
and security of our citizens under difficult conditions. 
 
Youth movement for Developed India 2020 
Recently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto 
of transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation 
created by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many 
districts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I 
happened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of 
Medak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is 
visible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage 
fear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student 
leader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she 
weaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from 
the Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country 
are on the right path 
through this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million 
youth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, 
under the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based 
education and leadership. 
 
Conclusion 
I was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural 
diversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours. I have cited thes e examples just to 
give a glimpse of the richness of our tradition and effort being take n by different agencies to preserve it. There are also many new adventures by instituti ons and individuals. I have 
experienced many of them and learnt a lot about my country and our peopl e. Even while 
pursuing our economic growth, we need to do a lot to preserve the rich and diverse 
treasures of our culture and civilization. It is our duty for our fut ure generations. This has 
to be done in a much larger scale through countrywide participatio n of multiple 
institutions. Our country is blessed with natural resources, has shown c onsiderable 
progress in the last sixty years, and above all we have hard wor king people particularly 
the power of the 540 million youth of the country. Every sector of our count ry has given 
me the 
confidence that India can become a developed nation well before 2020. Whomsoeve r, I 
met they constantly ask what they can give to the nation. We should c onstantly strive to 
empower such members of the society. With this spirit, I am extr emely happy that we are 
on the right path. Here I am reminded of a famous poem: 
"When you wish upon a star, 
Makes no difference who you are, 
Anything your heart desires, 
Will come to you” 
This poem is true to all of us, and particularly for our youth and i f they aim great, I am 
sure they will reach close to the target or the target. 
 
My dear citizens, let us resolve to continue to work for realizing the missions of 
developed India 2020 with the following distinctive profile. 
 
1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line. 
 
2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate acce ss to energy and 
quality water. 
 
3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service sector work together in sym phony. 
 
4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious 
candidates because of societal or economic discrimination. 
 
5. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented s cholars, scientists, and 
investors. 
 
6. A Nation where the best of health care is available to all. 
 
7. A Nation where the governance is responsive, transparent and corruption free. 
 
8. A Nation where poverty has been totally eradicated, illiterac y removed and crimes 
against women and children are absent and none in the society feels alienated. 
 
9. A Nation that is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful and happy a nd continues with a 
sustainable growth path. 
 10. A Nation that is one of the best places to live in and is proud of its leadership. 
 
Finally let me thank each one of you for showering your love and aff ection on me 
throughout the last five years by your cooperation and support. 
 
Dear Citizens, I conclude my address by sharing with you my mission in life which is to 
bring connectivity between billion hearts and minds of the people of Indi a in our 
multicultural society and to embed the self confidence that "we c an do it". I will be 
always with you, dear citizens, in the great mission of making Indi a a developed nation 
before 2020. 
 
May God bless you. 
 
Jai hind.
